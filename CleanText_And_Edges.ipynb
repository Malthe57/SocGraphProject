       "['Wrathion, the Black Prince, is one of the few black dragons on AzerothThe Characters of Warcraft/Wrathion known to be uncorrupted by the taint of the Old Gods and, following the death of Deathwing and the destruction of the corrupted black dragonflight, one of the last known black dragons alive on Azeroth. Claiming to have seen a future where Azeroth falls, Wrathion helped heroes of the Horde and Alliance gaining powers, usually in the form of magical legendary items. He is, however, ruthless in his goals and pursues what he perceives as the greater good for Azeroth with almost fanatical devotion. As the self-proclaimed last black dragon, Wrathion believes that the titans\\' mandate to protect Azeroth now falls to him, and he will do whatever it takes to fulfill this charge once entrusted to Deathwing,War Crimes that he personally identifies as his father. Most dragons do regard their aspect as their progenitor since they were the genesis of their kind out of the proto-drake stage of evolution, albeit through the direct hand of the titan watchers, but with Deathwing\\'s infamous history it carries a bit more significance. \\n\\nAfter being purified and hatched during the war against Deathwing, Wrathion saw to the death of every other black dragon he knew of, including his father. He decided to take on the appearance of a dark-skinned human for his mortal disguise, and provided an adventurer rogue with the Fangs of the Father to hunt down the last dragons of the black dragonflight in Azeroth. After he nearly survived an assassination attempt of the red dragonflight, he claimed to take his destiny into his own hands and disappeared.\\n\\nAs the Alliance-Horde war intensified on Pandaria, Wrathion traveled to the once hidden continent and created his own organization, he then sought to use an adventurer gifted with a powerful cloak of his own creation in a plot to have one side wipe out the other,Judgment of the Black Prince making the world more secure against greater threats.Celestial Blessings While his plan ultimately failed when King Varian Wrynn decided to make peace with Warchief Vol\\'jin instead of dismantling the Horde, Wrathion\\'s ambition to safeguard the world remained unchanged. After he helped Kairozdormu release Garrosh Hellscream during his trial, Wrathion stayed in the shadows, observing the conflict between the forces of Azeroth and the Iron Horde, and which side would win the war in Draenor.\\n\\nFor years he traveled across Azeroth, seeking a way to fight the madness that once corrupted his flight. Near the end of the Fourth War, as N\\'Zoth was the one primarily responsible for his father\\'s corruption, Wrathion once again offered his assistance.Return of the Black Prince This time, he created :Ashjra\\'kamas, Shroud of Resolve to help Azeroth\\'s champions resist the Old God\\'s corruptive influence. Following the end of the Old God, Wrathion vowed that the black dragonflight would forevermore stand in defense of Azeroth, alongside its champions.\\n\\nWith the Dragon Isles rediscovered, Wrathion now contends with Sabellian for the right to become the new Aspect of the black dragonflight.\\n\\nBiography\\nCataclysm\\n\\nthumb|The Purified Black Dragon Egg, which contains the unborn black whelp Wrathion.\\nThe ambitious red dragon Rheastrasza, also known by her goblin guise Rhea, traveled to the Badlands to research the black dragonflight and to find a way to purify them. She hired a group of mercenaries,The Bad Dogs and has captured the black dragon, Nyxondra, to force her to lay eggs for the experiments, in hopes of laying a uncorrupted black dragon egg.Third Sample: Implanted Eggs It was later revealed that Nyxondra was in fact a sister of Onyxia,Dave Kosak on Twitter and thus a daughter of Deathwing himself, the grandfather of Wrathion. \\n\\nUnhatched\\nEventually, Rheastrasza and Dr. Hieronymus Blam succeeded in creating a purified black dragon egg with an ancient titan device, a black whelp corpse, a wild black dragon egg and one of Nyxondra\\'s eggs.Return to Blam She constantly moved around to avoid being found by agents of the black dragonflight, who wanted to destroy the egg. She was however killed by Deathwing in the end, who was after the egg.Rheastrasza\\'s Gift The egg he destroyed, however, was not the purified one, but Rheastrasza\\'s own egg. Hieronymus Blam had already moved the real purified egg to a safer location, away from the Badlands, so it could continue to grow, out of Deathwing\\'s sight.The Egg Lives On The egg was hidden under the care of Corastrasza in Vermillion Redoubt, a Red dragonflight outpost in the Twilight Highlands.A Hidden Message\\n\\nHowever, six months later, shortly before he was born, the egg was stolen by the assassins of Ravenholdt. Consequently, the red dragonflight sent the red drake Mostrasz and a rogue adventurer to find it. The trail led them to Ravenholdt Manor,To Ravenholdt in the northeast of Hillsbrad Foothills, where it was revealed that Wrathion has hatched and was now in charge of the whole operation.To Catch a ThiefCataclysm Recap Video: Legendary Rogue (Part I of IV)\\n\\nThe Black Prince\\n\\nthumb|left|Wrathion, the Black Prince.\\nThough a whelping, Wrathion was wise and powerful beyond his years. Free of Deathwing\\'s control, he saw with clear eyes what had become of the black dragons, and recognized the threat they posed to Azeroth. He knew of only one way to purify the flight: death. Thus, he launched a brutal campaign to assassinate the world\\'s remaining black dragons.\\n\\nOn his first encounter with the rogue adventurer, he revealed that like all dragons he was conscious in his egg, listening to the plots and intrigues about him, and understood that he was born to be a prisoner. Therefore, he announced that he intended to stay free, and that the rogue adventurer were valuable to him, as they managed to reach him by eluding all his guards in the manor. At the same time, the right hand of the Black Prince, Fahrad, brought Mostrasz into the cellar after he captured him. Wrathion introduced himself to the latter as his former prisoner, and ordered him to serve as a messenger to his dragonflight, announcing that he was free from his father\\'s corruption, that he intended to remain free, that Deathwing\\'s minions should be afraid of him, and that this warning was the first and the last. He then ordered Fahrad to throw him out and to break his legs, before resuming his conversation with the rogue adventurer, explaining that dark dragons frequently disguise themselves as mortals to create chaos around them, and that the last survivors of the black dragonflight must be found and eliminated, as they are threats to Wrathion and Azeroth itself. In exchange for rewards, they agreed to help the Black Prince, and their first mission was located in the Ruins of Gilneas.Our Man in GilneasCataclysm Recap Video: Legendary Rogue (Part II of IV)\\n\\nAs the only pure member of his dragonflight, Wrathion decided that it was his misson to make sure that all his corrupted brothers and sisters must be destroyed. The first of them was Lord Hiram Creed, a black dragon disguised as an affluent Gilnean noble who manipulated a group of Gilnean humans and worgen named the Blackhowl in Gilneas City, secretly infecting them with his own draconic blood. As none of Ravenholdt\\'s assassins were able to infiltrate the city, the rogue adventurer was sent to assassinate the Drakonid, and managed to kill him, to the surprise of the Black Prince who was greatly impressed.Assassinate Creed He rewarded them with the daggers named Vengeance and Fear, and promised them more powers if they returned with some spell reagents acquired from Deathwing\\'s minions.The Deed is Done\\n\\nTo Wrathion\\'s surprise, his rogue champion returned some weeks later with what he asked, and eager for another assignment.Cluster Clutch In order to improve the daggers he offered them, he ordered the elimination of Nalice,Blood of the Betrayer a black dragon who served as the Ambassador of the Black Dragonflight in the Wyrmrest Accord, but who mysteriously disappeared from Wyrmrest Temple in the wake of Deathwing\\'s reemergence and his shattering of Azeroth. She was found by the Black Prince and his agents, hiding with her Blackwyrm Cult in the Master\\'s Cellar beneath Karazhan, researching arcane secrets buried beneath the foundation to perform some sort of arcane experiments.Our Man in Karazhan Pleasantly surprised by their victory, Wrathion used Nalice\\'s blood to upgrade the vicious twin daggers of his favorite assassin,Victory in the Depths before dispatching them again into the fray to collect more resources.Sharpening Your Fangs\\n\\nthumb|Wrathion confronts Fahrad, a black dragon, about the Old Gods\\' voices in his head.\\nthumb|Wrathion uses his powers to immobilize Fahrad.\\nAfter some weeks, Wrathion greeted his rogue champion fresh and ready for his hardest assignment, ignoring Fahrad\\'s warnings, he ordered the adventurer to kill his father. He warned them not to underestimate Deathwing, and that it would be necessary to annihilate him completely, otherwise the heart of his madness in his broken body would try to destroy them. He confessed that he wanted to help them, but couldn\\'t bring himself to do so, as the Black Aspect was the only dragon he feared. In secret, he told himself that it was the last time he saw his champion, not imagining for even a moment that they could accomplish their mission.Sharpening Your FangsCataclysm Recap Video: Legendary Rogue (Part III of IV) But once again, he underestimated them, and ultimately, his favorite assassin returned triumphant to collect their final reward after they destroyed the Worldbreaker with the heroes of Azeroth.\\n\\nHowever, prior to their arrival, the red dragonflight attacked Ravenholdt Manor to kill Wrathion, the latter managed to survive and killed Mostrasz himself, although many of its agents were killed in the battle. After rewarding his rogue champion one last time with :Golad, Twilight of Aspects and :Tiriosh, Nightmare of Ages, the legendary , he announced his final mission, to kill the last black dragon, Fahrad himself. The Black Prince revealed that he already knew the truth since the beginning, thanking the latter for saving him while he was still in his egg, but announced that as a black dragon he was also a victim of the corruption of the Old Gods and must be eliminated. Despite Fahrad insisting that he was in control, the Old Gods\\' voices in his head were angered by Wrathion\\'s actions and forced Fahrad to try to kill the Black Prince, as he was too difficult to control. As Fahrad revealed his true nature, Wrathion announced that he would never be controlled, that the red dragonflight had no idea what they unleashed when they had experimented on his egg, before he immobilized his former ally and ordered the rogue adventurer to deal the killing blow with his new powers.Cataclysm Recap Video: Legendary Rogue (Part IV of IV)\\n\\nFollowing their victory, Wrathion announced that to his knowledge he was the last black dragon in Azeroth, and that it was time for him to disappear, expecting to meet his rogue champion once again in the future. With his destiny in his own hands, he left the assassins of Ravenholdt behind to seek his destiny elsewhere, as he heard rumors of a new land \"beyond the mists of the sea\".Cataclysm Recap Video: Legendary Rogue (Part IV of IV)\\n\\nWith his bloody work done, Wrathion stood as one of the last living black dragons.\\n\\nMists of Pandaria\\n\\nthumb|upright|Wrathion at the Tavern in the Mists.\\nIn Pandaria, Wrathion made his base in the Tavern in the Mists, which is found in the Veiled Stair, after experiencing a vision of Azeroth\\'s destruction.Annual 2015 To prevent his vision from becoming a reality, Wrathion sent invitations to adventurers from all walks of life to aid him in shaping the course of the coming conflict.Stranger in a Strange Land (quest)\\n\\nWrathion foreshadowed a terrible threat to Azeroth coming, a threat that a divided Azeroth couldn\\'t hope to stand against; the Burning Legion. Thus he believed the only way to prepare Azeroth for the coming threat was to have one faction win and dominate the other. He advised adventurers to bring a swift end to the Alliance-Horde war and gave his unwavering support to whichever faction the adventurer belonged to.A Legend in the Making\\n\\nWrathion challenged the adventurers he recruited to prove their strength to him by vanquishing the mogu minions who inhabit Shan\\'ze Dao, and the sha-corrupted mantid swarming the Dread Wastes. He also tasked adventurers to acquire sigils of power and wisdom from fallen heroes in the Mogu\\'shan Vaults, the Heart of Fear, or the Terrace of Endless Spring.The Strength of One\\'s Foes After slaying enough of these enemies to earn an honored reputation with him,Trial of the Black Prince Wrathion challenged the adventurer to hunt down the Sha of Fear and despoil it of its :Chimera of Fear. After taking down the sha at the Terrace of Endless Spring,Fear Itself and accomplishing all of his undertakings, Wrathion took the adventurers to Mason\\'s Folly where he used the combined powers of the sigils of power and wisdom; as well as the chimera of fear to create a sha-touched gem. After Wrathion gifted the gem to his champion,Breath of the Black Prince (quest) he asked them to let him know when their faction\\'s naval fleet arrived; and also proclaimed that no matter how unsavory his methods become, he would remain resolute in his protection of Azeroth.Incoming...\\n\\nLandfall\\nAfter the faction\\'s fleet arrived in Pandaria, Wrathion wanted to test the adventurer\\'s commitment to the Alliance-Horde war and thus tasked them to kill enemy faction soldiers at the shores in order to prove that their faction deserves to win the war.The Prince\\'s Pursuit Then, in the Tavern in the Mists, Wrathion summoned images of King Varian Wrynn and Warchief Garrosh Hellscream to talk about their pasts and how they fared as leaders.The Measure of a Leader Wrathion also wanted to test the adventurer\\'s valor by having them gather 3,000 Valor Points. He used his blood to see through their eyes, thus monitoring their progress.A Test of Valor (quest) Afterwards, Wrathion requested that they kill their opposing faction\\'s commander in Krasarang Wilds.A Change of Command In addition to slaughtering the enemy commander, Wrathion required that they achieve a victory in both Silvershard Mines and Temple of Kotmogu.The Lion RoarsGlory to the Horde After all these tasks, he brought up the faction leaders again and discussed their merits as leaders and what he\\'s learned about each respective faction. He asked the adventurers to continue to hone their skills in Pandaria and then armed them with the :Eye of the Black Prince to increase their prowess. At last, he brought up about a new threat: Emperor Lei Shen, the Thunder King.Call of the PackmasterThe Soul of the Horde\\n\\nRise of the Thunder King\\nthumb|left|Wrathion seen as a whelp at the Thunder Forges.\\nthumb|Wrathion and Anduin chatting.\\nthumb|Wrathion and Deathwing in Lorewalker Cho\\'s story. \\nIn the Tavern in the Mists, while Anduin Wrynn was recovering from his wounds, he played the pandaren board game jihui with Wrathion. Both of them have been discussing current events and as they played, they discussed Lei Shen the Thunder King, and his leadership style; to which they disagreed with each other if whether his tyrannical and brutal reign should be applauded or not. Anduin disapproved of Wrathion\\'s hard cutthroat outlook and Wrathion likewise thought Anduin too soft. At this point, Wrathion recruited the adventurer to act as his champion and to show his might by terrorizing any mogu, Zandalari, or saurok they could find.\\n\\nAs Wrathion desired to know the origin and source of mogu power, Azeroth\\'s adventurers aided the Black Prince in finding out what it was. The search for information took them into the depths of the Thunder King\\'s Palace, the Throne of Thunder, where they collected for him 20 :Secrets of the Empire and 40 Trillium Bars.Secrets of the First Empire Wrathion and the adventurer then progressed to the Thunder Forges where he planed to use all the trillium they gathered to forge an instrument of power that he claimed he would used for the purpose of \"world peace\". Once they got the Thunder Forge up and running, Wrathion tasked the adventurer to defend the Celestial Blacksmith from the sha until it finished forging the :Lightning Lance. Once completed, Wrathion\\'s champion used the Lightning Lance to vanquish the Sha Amalgamation. Although the Lightning Lance proved itself a useful weapon, it needed to be charged by the power of the Thunder King in order to wake it from its dormancy.The Thunder Forge (quest) Wrathion then asked his champion to assault the Foot of Lei Shen and to use the Lightning Lance on Storm Lord Nalak before slaying the beast.Spirit of the Storm Lord From the mogu artifacts the adventurer collected, Wrathion learned how to create the legendary metagem, Crown of the Heavens. After imbuing the Lightning Lance with Nalak\\'s power, the adventurer and Wrathion returned to Mason\\'s Folly where they created the Sha-Touched gem. There, Wrathion used the Lightning Lance to create the :Crown of Heaven, which he gifted to his champion.The Crown of Heaven\\n\\nAnduin distrusted Wrathion and warned the adventurer to think twice before putting that thing on their head. As Wrathion needed more information to piece together how the mogu related to the titans, he sent the adventurer back to the Throne of Thunder to collect 12 Titan Runestones, which an image of Wrathion used to uncover mogu history as he translated the stones.Echoes of the Titans\\n\\nOnce all of them have been translated, Wrathion wanted the adventurer to kill Lei Shen himself, to bring him the :Heart of the Thunder King, and end the Thunder King\\'s reign once and for all. Once the heart was given to Wrathion, he ate it and absorbed its titan magic. A glowing light appeared, showing Wrathion cosmic visions and spoke through Wrathion of a fallen titan that some mysterious power sought to rebuild. As the light faded away, Wrathion seemed to have forgotten all the information and thought the predecessors of the titans\\' power have forgotten as well. Not even Anduin could comprehend the message. To that regard, it was the message that the mogu didn\\'t remember all this time, and Wrathion laughed at the irony of it. Anduin still didn\\'t trust Wrathion, and the latter told him that it was wise that he didn\\'t. He then asked the adventurer to give him time to \"digest\" what he has learned.Heart of the Thunder King (quest)\\n\\nEscalation\\nthumb|Wrathion empowering the Timeless Essence of the Black Dragonflight.\\nAfter Lei Shen was dead, and his artifacts were in the hands of the Horde and Alliance, Wrathion wanted to empower his champion with the full array of his draconic power, but their mortal body wasn\\'t capable of holding such power. Instead, Wrathion planed to create a cloak of virtue that they could imbue with the power of the August Celestials and some of his own as well. To create such a vessel, Wrathion required the blessings of all the August Celestials, which was only granted to those who completed their challenges. Thus Wrathion and his champion set off for the celestials\\' temples to fulfill their quest.\\n\\nAt Niuzao Temple, Niuzao tested the adventurer\\'s fortitude; at the Temple of the Red Crane, Chi-Ji tested their hope; at the Temple of the White Tiger, Xuen tested their strength; and at the Temple of the Jade Serpent, Yu\\'lon tested their wisdom.Celestial Blessings With the blessing of each of the celestials, Wrathion was able to create the :Cloak of Virtue at Mason\\'s Folly, which he gifted to his champion. Although the cloak of virtue granted the champion the power of the celestials, Wrathion was still searching for a way to imbue his own draconic power onto the cloak.Preparing to Strike\\n\\nSiege of Orgrimmar\\nthumb|Wrathion breathes fire in a fit of anger.\\nWrathion was eager to explore the secrets of the Timeless Isle, and with good reason: the island held the secret of imbuing celestial cloaks with his own formidable draconic power.A Timeless Discovery Wrathion tasked his champion to collect 5,000 Timeless Coins so that he could deconstruct their mysterious power in order to enhance his champion\\'s cloak.Secrets of the Timeless Isle He also challenged his champion to showcase their capabilities to the public of the Celestial Court by defeating the August Celestials in combat.The Emperor\\'s Way Bearers of this new legendary-quality cloak were able to do battle with the deadly Ordos atop the Timeless Isle, but that wasn\\'t Wrathion\\'s ultimate goal. Instead, the black prince hoped to send his empowered cloak-bearers into the bowels of Orgrimmar to overthrow Warchief Garrosh Hellscream himself. Wrathion also participated in the Celestial Tournament with his companions - Alex, Dah\\'da, and Cindy. After the Celestials are defeated, Wrathion, Lorewalker Cho and the adventurer return to the Seat of Knowledge where they narrate the legend of the adventurer. Cho wished for the legend to portray the adventurer as a hero, liberator, and protector, while Wrathion wished to see them as a conqueror with none able to stand in their way.A Pandaren Legend After the legend was done, Wrathion sent the adventurer to the Siege of Orgrimmar to fulfill his hopes.\\n\\nWhen the adventurer arrived back in the Tavern in the Mists, Wrathion was pacing around the room; awaiting information about what happened during the Siege of Orgrimmar. The adventurer told him about what happened in Orgrimmar and he was not happy with the outcome: calling Varian Wrynn a fool for allowing the Horde to continue existing. Tong the Fixer was infuriated with his constant speaking and his lack of understanding of the lessons of Pandaria. Tong said that the Alliance and the Horde were not strong despite each other, they were strong because of one another. Wrathion thought he was just a fool waiter, and started walking out the Tavern and proclaimed for the battle to come, he would leave nothing to chance.Judgment of the Black Prince\\n\\nWar Crimes\\n\\nWrathion, alongside his bodyguards, Right and Left, attended the trial of Garrosh Hellscream, frequently corresponding with Anduin Wrynn during intermissions. He came to acknowledge the prince of Stormwind as a personal friend, though he told him that his kind heart and desire to see good in the world would be his undoing. He sat as far from Alexstrasza as he could.\\n\\nEventually, Wrathion revealed himself to be working with Kairozdormu and the Infinite dragonflight to free Garrosh and send him back in time to the  of thirty-five years ago. After incapacitating the Chu brothers so he could lock up Chromie for investigating Kairoz, Wrathion was confronted by Anduin, who attempted to deter his friend from freeing the captured warchief. Proclaiming that as the last of the black dragonflight, the protection of Azeroth now falls to him, Wrathion knocked Anduin out and took his leave. Despite his actions, Wrathion believed this would be best for Azeroth in the coming conflict with the Legion, and maintained hope that Anduin would eventually understand his motives and even stand with him as a brother when the time comes.\\n\\nWarlords of Draenor\\n\\nthumb|Wrathion outside Khadgar\\'s Tower in Talador.\\nWrathion, having traveled to the alternate Draenor after the Dark Portal became connected to it, traveled to Admiral Taylor\\'s Garrison in the Spires of Arak, brought there by Sir Edward. Wrathion sought asylum in the Garrison, claiming he had somehow angered the local ogres. As Wrathion was a wanted fugitive of the Alliance following the events of Garrosh\\'s trial, the troops led by Lady Claudia took aim. Admiral Taylor claimed that Wrathion would be a \"guest\" in the Garrison provided he stay under house arrest and full-time guard.\\n\\nWrathion provided Taylor\\'s Garrison the resources to build an inn, and when Taylor confronted him about it Wrathion told him not to trust Ephial. Taylor offered a group of guards money to keep a close eye on Wrathion, but Wrathion had already paid those very same guards to watch Taylor. When Taylor left to participate in the , Wrathion left the Garrison and took several of Taylor\\'s best followers with him.Admiral Taylor\\'s Garrison Log\\n\\nWrathion remained in hiding somewhere on Draenor until he made a minor cameo at Khadgar\\'s Tower once the adventurer had to return the Tomes of Chaos to Cordana Felsong. Wrathion was momentarily seen sitting on a Kirin Tor banner in whelp form until seeing his former ally, upon which he quickly flew off to parts unknown.Cooking the Books\\n\\nLegion\\n\\nDuring the third invasion of the Burning Legion, Wrathion wandered around Azeroth.BlizzCon 2016 Q&A\\n\\nDeaths of Chromie\\nWhen Chronormu and an adventurer discovered that the former was going to die in the near future, they began searching for clues to who could be behind her assassination across the future Dragonshrines in Dragonblight. At the pathway leading into the Obsidian Dragonshrine, they found Wrathion, who was bemused by skeletons occupying the shrine even though the dragons had abandoned it for some years, musing that his father would never have approved. Chromie and the adventurer confronted Wrathion, thinking he may have known something, and Wrathion was ashamed that Chromie suspected him simply for being a black dragon. As Wrathion explained, he knew nothing about the attack and was simply visiting Northrend for \"[his] own amusement\", but was surprised to see a demonic infestation at the Obsidian Dragonshrine. He reminded Chromie and the adventurer that if they were looking for someone who might take umbrage at a dragon, they should start with the undead and whoever was controlling them. Chromie agreed that Wrathion made a fair point and the two of them left him to search inside the dragonshrine.Preserve the True Future\\n\\nBattle for Azeroth\\n\\nAfter finding an :Unscarred Black Scale from a young black dragon while on an island expedition, the adventurer knew that Wrathion would want to hear about it and sought him out at Blackrock Mountain. Though Wrathion was not there himself, one of his Blacktalon Agents was. She revealed to the adventurer that Wrathion was searching for the Dragon Isles and that other dragons had not been forthcoming in information.Unscarred Black Scale (quest)\\n\\nOne of Wrathion\\'s Blacktalon Watchers was in the former lair of Deathwing, observing as another uncorrupted black dragon, Ebyssian, took an essence of the black dragonflight\\'s magic to help heal the world.A Friendly Face Later, more Blacktalon Watchers could be found in Nazjatar and in the Blackrock Mountain.\\n\\nWhen Wrathion was next seen, he had physically matured significantly, his humanoid form now resembling a young man with jet black hair, a short beard, and red, burning eyes. He sought out the Shen\\'dralar library in Dire Maul,Torn Journal Page #7 as well as the aid of the Lorewalkers and Shado-Pan,Torn Journal Page #16 in order to find a way to counter the Old Gods\\' corruption. He also traveled to the Vault of Archavon in Wintergrasp, hoping that it would contain information on the Forge of Origination which, he felt, would be the key to defeating the Old Gods for good. Unfortunately, the giants that watched over the Vault were not trusting of him.Torn Journal Page #25 Wrathion then journeyed to Karazhan, where he received information from the library that allowed him to craft a potion that could cleanse someone of Old God corruption. While within the tower, Wrathion also met with the shade of Medivh, who encouraged him that while Wrathion could not change the past, he could forge a new legacy to leave for the future.Torn Journal Page #58 As all this was going on, the Old Gods reached out to another uncorrupted black dragon, Ebyssian, and began to corrupt him. At the behest of Kalecgos, the adventurer sought out Wrathion for aid, and it turned out that the Old Gods\\' servants were also in pursuit of the Black Prince. While neither of them found Wrathion himself, the adventurer was able to find Wrathion\\'s potion in Karazhan and used it to save Ebyssian.Save Ebonhorn\\n\\nVisions of N\\'Zoth\\nthumb|left|upright|Wrathion entering Stormwind Keep.\\nthumb|Anduin Wrynn punching Wrathion.\\nthumb|Wrathion in his drake\\'s form.\\nAs the Alliance and the Horde defeated Azshara, and in the process let N\\'Zoth free from its prison, the Horde and the Alliance had to consider how to deal with the new threat looming. Wrathion, who had not been seen since Garrosh was freed, appeared in Stormwind City with Magni. He came to advise Anduin on how to deal with N\\'Zoth. Wrathion told Anduin that the armies of Stormwind would be useless. N\\'Zoth will strike in the mind.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB7DKeye3pE - Visions of N\\'Zoth - Intro Cinematic Later he joined Magni back at the Chamber of Heart and guided the adventurers in dealing with the visions of N\\'Zoth. Revealing that the best way to protect one\\'s mind against the Old Gods required an object pure corruption, Wrathion and adventurers ventured to Blackwing Descent atop the Blackrock Mountain in Burning Steppes. Upon arriving, the pair discovered that N\\'Zoth\\'s agents had seized control of Nefarian\\'s liar, and Dark Inquisitor Xanesh planned on making Nefarian\\'s legacy their own. Amidst the fighting, Wrathion was captured with the Dark Inquisitor revealing her intentions to use his essence to resurrect both Nefarian and Onyxia as tools of war for N\\'Zoth. However, Xanesh failed when adventurers freed Wrathion, who declared that the black dragonflight would purge N\\'Zoth from Azeroth. Following Xanesh\\'s retreat into Ny\\'alotha, Wrathion destroyed the remains of Nefarian and Onyxia and used the :Corrupt Black Dragonscales left behind to create Ashjra\\'kamas. Declaring that this cloak was all that remained of the once-proud black dragonflight, Wrathion revealed that it would defend them from sanity loss and the corruption of N\\'Zoth.Beginning the Descent\\n\\nSometime after Wrathion arrived to the Chamber of Heart, Ebyssian inquired as to how the Black Prince had known he had begun to hear N\\'Zoth\\'s whispers. In response, Wrathion admitted that he had one of his agents watching over him due to knowing that Ebyssian would become vulnerable upon leaving Highmountain. In a surprise, Ebyssian remarked that he was unaware that Wrathion had such a personal concern for his well-being, causing the younger dragon to remark that they were brothers and the only one that Wrathion had left.Ebyssian#Chamber of Heart\\n\\nthumb|Wrathion stabs the Carapace of N\\'Zoth with Xal\\'atath, helping the heroes to defeat the Old God.\\nAs adventurers entered Ny\\'alotha they had to face Wrathion, the Black Emperor, who was supposedly a Wrathion who had given in to the Old Gods\\' corruption, but after killing it they discovered that it was a faceless one in disguise rather than the Black Prince himself. Wrathion was present within the realm of N\\'Zoth, however. He was given the Blade of the Black Empire by Azshara who told him to stab N\\'Zoth in the heart with it.Dark Inquisitor Xanesh Wrathion instead stabbed the Carapace of N\\'Zoth which during the fight with the Fury of N\\'Zoth helped adventurers regain their sanity by teleporting back to him. Following the death of N\\'Zoth, when asked as to what lied next for him, Wrathion remarked that though the Old Gods had been vanquished, they were but one threat to Azeroth and that many more lurked on the horizon and in the shadows. He further declared that from this day forth the black dragonflight will honor its ancient charge and stand in defense of Azeroth, along with its champions.\\n\\nThe adventurers also brought forth young dragons of the twilight dragonflight, ones which had been raised inside N\\'Zoth\\'s carapace and so been exposed more directly to his corruption. Wrathion clears the dragons\\' minds of the whispers, with the promise that they, as well as he himself, will find themselves again one day despite their pasts.Lost Flight\\n\\nThe Vow Eternal\\n\\nWhile staying at the Summer\\'s Rest inn in Pandaria in his search for the Dragon Isles, Wrathion has a nightmare of transforming into Deathwing. In this nightmare he at first serves as the uncorrupted Earth-Warder and leader of the black dragonflight, only for a shadow to wash over him and turn him into his father. He is attacked by his allies, not only the Aspects and their flights but even his fellow black dragons.\\n\\nHe later attends the wedding of Thalyssra and Lor\\'themar Theron in Suramar. At the reception he encounters Kurog Grimtotem, who accuses all dragons of being unnatural but especially him because of the nature of his birth. Already stressed, Kurog\\'s egging on makes Wrathion snap and threaten him, but Kalecgos intervenes before Wrathion can go too far. With Thalyssra\\'s arrival to see what the commotion was, Kurog leaves while threatening that soon they would all know the true power of the tauren. Wrathion is rocked by what he had almost done, and remembers his nightmare where he turned into Deathwing with fear.\\n\\nWrathion leaves for the vineyard, and Kalecgos follows him with two glasses of arcwine. The two discuss the black dragonflight\\'s poor reputation and the falls of both Neltharion and Malygos. They muse on how both of their flights\\' former Aspects had been best friends, and Wrathion wonders if the two of them couldn\\'t spark a friendship as well. Kalec turns the conversation to the Dragon Isles, and Wrathion admits he has not learned anything new. Chromie had seemed confused when Wrathion had asked, Ysera is dead so can\\'t be asked, and Nozdormu wouldn\\'t even grant him an audience. Even Alexstrasza had only told him that the isles were lost.\\n\\nKalec and Wrathion both realize that they are experiencing a sensation of loneliness, or a weight on their chest, of feeling something they could not articulate that they wanted but could not have. The two of them doubt both experiencing this could be a coincidence, and wonder if other dragons are experiencing it as well. The two travel to Wyrmrest Temple to ask Alexstrasza further questions, where they discover that many other dragons have also assembled in a mass gathering at the temple\\'s base, all feeling the same sensation. Rather than wait, Wrathion flies to the top of the temple to speak to Alexstrasza personally.\\n\\nAtop the temple, he finds not only Alexstrasza but Nozdormu and Merithra as well. Alexstrasza tells him that they have heard the call of the reawakening Dragon Isles, a sensation reaching out to the hearts of all dragons. The feeling that Wrathion and all the others were feeling is homesickness, and Wrathion realizes he is finally being welcomed, and has a place to belong. The feeling of emptiness in his heart becomes one of joy, and he decides that his recurring nightmare is not a forecast of doom, but a challenge to be conquered. Now that he has a home, Wrathion vows that it will be him, not Deathwing, that will guide the black dragons into a new future.The Vow Eternal\\n\\nDragonflight\\n\\nWrathion struggled as to whether he truly desired to be the leader of the black dragonflight. Nevertheless, with the return of the Dragon Isles to Azeroth, he returned to his flight\\'s ancient homeland. Despite their past disagreements, Alexstrasza offered him guidance.2022-04-20, WORLD OF WARCRAFT: DRAGONFLIGHT INTERVIEW WITH JACKIE WILEY AND TINA WANG. Blizzplanet, retrieved on 2022-04-22\\n\\nWhen the Dragon Isles were uncovered, Ebyssian and Wrathion traveled to the Forbidden Reach and discovered the dracthyr, ancient creations of Neltharion that had been in stasis for 20,000 years. They helped the dracthyr battle the invading Primalists and the freed Primal Incarnate Raszageth. When the Primalists fled, Nozdormu told the dracthyr to warn the nations of the world of the oncoming threat, and Wrathion took the Obsidian Warders to Stormwind to introduce them to the Alliance. Afterward, Wrathion went to ask the Aspects who Raszageth was, and learned that she and the rest of the Incarnates were ancient enemies of the Aspects who sought to cleanse the world of the titans\\' \"stain\". The Aspects decided to reclaim the powers they had lost when they defeated Deathwing, for without that power they wouldn\\'t be able to defeat the Incarnates.\\n\\nWhen Wrathion brought Scalecommander Azurathel and the Obsidian Warders to Stormwind City, he mentioned that they would be well received through its connections with the leaders of the city. However, the opposite happened, and they were soon received by the Stormwind Army and the Spymaster Mathias Shaw who reminded the black dragon that he has been warned against making unannounced visits, especially when he brings company. In order to calm the situation, Wrathion apologized and announced his request to deliver a message from the Dragon Aspects to Lord Commander Turalyon. The Spymaster agreed to allow the dracthyr to visit the city but warned them that the SI:7 would be watching them closely and that the responsibility of their actions would fall on the Black Prince.Ground Leave (Alliance) In the Stormwind Keep, Wrathion briefed Turalyon on the recent events, and have extended the Aspects\\' invitation to the Dragon Isles. During a conversation between them and Scalecommander Azurathel, he thanked Turalyon for accepting the invitation and then mentioned that the Dragon Queen insisted that the Alliance should not bring any conflict to the islands with the Horde. After Turalyon claimed that the Alliance would honor its truce with the Horde, and that he instructed the Explorers\\' League to work in concert with the Reliquary, the Black Prince announced that he was delighted with the turn of events, and that it was time to prepare the expedition for departure to the Dragon Isles.Aspectral Invitation (Dracthyr, Alliance)\\n\\nIn the Waking Shores, Wrathion and his Blacktalon forces fought to free the black dragonflight\\'s ancient fortress the Obsidian Citadel from the djaradin. During the fighting, Deathwing\\'s long-lost son Sabellian returned from Outland where he had been for the last several decades, along with more surviving black dragons and a clutch of eggs that Wrathion had not been aware of. Wrathion restored the Obsidian Oathstone, only for Sabellian to declare his own intention of becoming the new Dragon Aspect of the black flight. The two began a competition for the throne. Sabellian and Wrathion also delivered the clutch of black eggs to the Ruby Lifeshrine for safekeeping.\\n\\nWorld of Warcraft Anniversary\\nthumb|Wrathion and Medivh in the Caverns of Time during the 15th Anniversary Event.\\n\\nMedivh and Wrathion were found partaking in the festivities of Warcraft\\'s Anniversary in the Caverns of Time.\\n\\nSells\\n\\nLocations\\n\\nQuests\\nRavenholdt Manor\\nTo Catch a Thief \\nOur Man in Gilneas \\nThe Deed is Done \\nCluster Clutch \\nOur Man in Karazhan \\nVictory in the Depths \\nSharpening Your Fangs \\nPatricide \\n\\nTavern in the Mists\\n\\n5.1.

Certainly he\\'s in Deathwing\\'s lineage. He considers DW to be his father, FWIW.\"Dave Kosak on Twitter (2013-04-30)\\n\"Wrathion likely took the \"Prince\" title himself, claiming to be the \"true\" heir of Deathwing.\"\\n\\nWhile Wrathion\\'s mother is clearly Nyxondra, the identity of his father is unclear. Neltharion/Deathwing is the leader of the black dragonflight and as such is likely seen as the father of the entire flight (which could be why he refers to Deathwing\\'s actions and why the legendary daggers are named Fangs of the Father). As there is no real shortage of other named (and unnamed) male black dragons, Wrathion\\'s actual father could have been any of them.\\n\\nThe Ultimate Visual Guide lists Wrathion as Deathwing\\'s son and as Onyxia\\'s and Nefarian\\'s half-sibling.\\n\\nKosak later stated that Nyxondra was Onyxia\\'s sister and tweeted out the following:\\n\"It\\'s kinda kooky, but Wrathion\\'s mother Nyxondra was Onyxia\\'s sister... so... Yeah black dragons are freaky.\"\\n\"You guys are right, Deathwing isn\\'t technically Wrathion\\'s direct biological father.\"Dave Kosak on Twitter\\n\\nThis would mean that Deathwing is Wrathion\\'s grandfather, not his father. This would also make Onyxia and Nefarian his aunt and uncle, respectively. This also corresponds with Wrathion\\'s own words when he called Onyxia his auntie.Judgment of the Black Prince\\n\\nOddly enough, an official page stated that Wrathion is a child of Deathwing,Archived page and War Crimes mentions Wrathion being sired by Deathwing.War Crimes, chapter 5 However, Wrathion was not technically sired by another black dragon, his egg was artificially created by the Eye of the Watchers which magically combined the purified matter of one of Nyxondra\\'s eggs with another wild black dragon egg of unknown parentage and a black whelp corpse.Return to Blam Annual 2015 also lists Deathwing as Wrathion\\'s father.\\n\\nIn Ultimate Visual Guide, Updated and Expanded, all mentions of Wrathion being related to Deathwing and his children are removed. In Wrathion\\'s entry, Nyxondra is listed as his only known relative.World of Warcraft: Ultimate Visual Guide, Updated and Expanded, pg. 197\\n\\nDue to these contradictions, Wrathion\\'s heritage was subject to much debate, with different sources giving different ideas as to how Wrathion fits into Deathwing\\'s family tree.\\n\\nIn Battle for Azeroth, there are still references of calling Deathwing his father. In Dragonflight Sabellian calls Wrathion his little brother, rather than his nephew, which he should be if Deathwing is his grandfather.\\n\\nDave Kosak on Wrathion\\nDuring an interview with WoW Insider in 2012 Lead Quest Designer Dave Kosak talked about Wrathion:\\nWhen we had written that questline in the Badlands there, we knew that this would be a cool story thread to pick up some day. But if you really think about how long it would take a dragon to mature and start developing his own thoughts, it\\'d be a long time. Like decades. And we didn\\'t really have time for that! So I said well, OK -- if we ask people to buy into this one thing, that because of these experiments he can have some self-awareness early on, wow - what an interesting character that is!\\n\\nAll of a sudden he\\'s so compelling. Because let\\'s see, his father was crazy and tried to destroy the world, his mother was basically raped by the red dragonflight, then his egg was experimented on to sever his ties with his own family - so how do you view the world at that point? Well, you don\\'t really view the world as a friendly place. You\\'re probably eager to take control of your own destiny, which he does, even before he hatches. And then you kind of have this thing to atone for - your father tried to destroy the world. Your father went crazy. Are you crazy? How do you not be crazy, how do you make up for what your father did. Suddenly he\\'s such a cool character! I really want to explore that character. We kind of went nuts with it. So we kind of asked people -- well if you can already buy in to the idea that he hatched from his egg and already started hatching schemes, then there\\'s a whole cool story that can come from that. And we really rolled with it.\\n\\nThat was kind of the genesis of that character. His value to the franchise is he really can kind of stand above Alliance and Horde, and really try and be a good guy, but without all the moral reservations that most good guys have. He really does have the best interests of Azeroth in mind, but his interests may not necessarily line up with our interests. His plan may not be the way that we would think of planning it. That kind of gray area between hero and villain is so cool for us, very cool to explore. And you\\'re never sure whether you should trust him or not. It helps that we got a wonderful voice actor who really gets that across. He gets that kind of, that air of arrogance and also a little bit of smarminess. You know, like you like him, but don\\'t trust him at the same time. Wonderful, wonderful characterization.WoW Insider interviews Lead Quest Designer Dave Kosak\\n\\nIn Hearthstone\\n\\nthumb|Wrathion in Hearthstone.\\nWrathion appears as  in the Mean Streets of Gadgetzan expansion for Hearthstone. Despite being a black dragon, his Hearthstone card lacks the Dragon minion type due to him using his human guise, a fact that is referenced by his flavor text:\"Wrathion, son of Deathwing, is a dragon. Why isn\\'t he tagged as a dragon, you ask? WHAT, ARE YOU TRYING TO BLOW HIS COVER??\"\\n\\nNotes and trivia\\nWrathion was two years old in Mists of Pandaria, in Year 30.Steve Danuser on the WoW forums This makes him five to six years old in Battle for Azeroth, in Years 33-34, and twelve years old in Dragonflight, in Year 40.\\nWrathion is one of the only dragons in the game the players have seen in all three forms of a dragon\\'s life. Having been introduced as a whelp, Wrathion was a drake by the time of Ny\\'alotha. And while a phantasm, Wrathion, the Black Emperor, shows a potential version of Wrathion as a dragon.\\nHe shares this distinction with Tarecgosa, though canonic depictions of her only appear through Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa\\'s Rest\\'s drake form, and her normal dragon form. Unlike Wrathion, where all three forms are encountered in a story perspective, Lil\\' Tarecgosa is only a pet.\\nWrathion has had several unique models. His original incarnation was as a young adult human male and featured dragonscale attire topped by a turban. His second appearance expanded upon this, abandoning the turban for long flowing hair. As a dragon, Wrathion was not given a unique model (his whelp model was the standard one) until he was given his drake form. A depiction of him as a corrupted dragon was also given for the Ny\\'alotha raid.\\nNotably, his second human form depiction uses the blood elf male animations instead of the human male ones as his previous incarnation did.\\nBy the time of the trial of Garrosh Hellscream, Wrathion was about the size of a large dog in his dragon form.War Crimes, chapter 27\\nWrathion and Deathwing briefly appear in Gods and Monsters (quest), a story told by Lorewalker Cho.\\nIn some ways, the Burning Legion\\'s massive third invasion was ultimately Wrathion\\'s fault. The invasion only occurred thanks to the alternate Gul\\'dan discovering and being sent to Azeroth, neither of which would have happened had Wrathion left Garrosh in prison. While the Legion would have returned regardless, Wrathion\\'s manipulations cost Azeroth numerous lives against the Iron Horde, Primals, Breakers, and other enemies; all lives who could\\'ve been better spent fighting the Legion. Anduin echoes this view in Battle for Azeroth.\\nWrathion is voiced by Aaron Phillips.Video Game: World of Warcraft\\nA number of fans pair him with Anduin Wrynn. In response, Christie Golden tweeted \"their relationship is only good friends.\"Christie Golden on TwitterChristie Golden on Twitter\\nIn the Legion alpha, Wrathion was in Highmountain disguised as Spiritwalker Ebonhorn, and at the end of his questline he gathered time-lost black dragon eggs to raise new, uncorrupted black dragons. In later builds he was replaced as Ebonhorn by Ebyssian and the questline was rewritten, mainly because it made little sense for Wrathion to have become a trusted sage of the Highmountain tauren in such a short amount of time.Gamescom Developer Interview Wrathion was based at the Obsidian Overlook, along with several characters from the Tavern in the Mists.\\nDuring the Battle for Azeroth demo at BlizzCon 2017, Wrathion could be found at the Stormwind Embassy.Blizzcon 2017: Battle for Azeroth Demo By the time the patch 7.3.5 PTR started, adding the embassy to the city, he had been removed.\\nHis bodyguards, Left and Right, might be inspired by the twin guardsmen of Olenna Tyrell from the  novels, who refers to her protectors as \"Left\" and \"Right\" since she cannot tell them apart. In the Witcher universe, the dragon Villentretenmerth also had the habit of being protected by two female human bodyguards that he referred to as \"his weapons\".\\nAccording to Associate Game Director Jeremy Feasel, Wrathion\\'s scimitar is named Succession.\\n\\nGallery\\n\\nFan art\\n\\nVideos\\n\\nPatch changes\\n\\nSee also\\nFangs of the Father\\nWrathion\\'s Recorded Journal\\nImage of Wrathion\\nImage of Wrathion (Throne of Thunder)\\nI am Legendary\\nWrathion (Battle of the Aspects Treasure), TCG card\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links\\n\\nCategory:Black whelps\\nCategory:Black drakes\\nCategory:Specialty vendors\\nCategory:Black Prince\\nCategory:Quest givers\\nCategory:Hillsbrad Foothills NPCs\\nCategory:Veiled Stair NPCs\\nCategory:Isle of Thunder NPCs\\nCategory:Jade Forest NPCs\\nCategory:Kun-Lai Summit NPCs\\nCategory:Townlong Steppes NPCs\\nCategory:Krasarang Wilds NPCs\\nCategory:Timeless Isle NPCs\\nCategory:Removed Talador NPCs\\nCategory:Chamber of Heart NPCs\\nCategory:War Crimes characters\\nCategory:Unique voices\\nCategory:Unique models\\nCategory:Hearthstone legendary cards\\nCategory:Deaths of Chromie NPCs\\nCategory:WoW\\'s Anniversary\\nCategory:Caverns of Time NPCs\\nCategory:Stormwind City NPCs\\nCategory:Ny\\'alotha, the Waking City NPCs\\nCategory:The Vow Eternal characters\\nCategory:Forbidden Reach NPCs\\n\\nes:Wrathion\\npl:Wrathion']"

       "['Wrathion, the Black Prince, is one of the few black dragons on AzerothThe Characters of Warcraft/Wrathion known to be uncorrupted by the taint of the Old Gods and, following the death of Deathwing and the destruction of the corrupted black dragonflight, one of the last known black dragons alive on Azeroth. Claiming to have seen a future where Azeroth falls, Wrathion helped heroes of the Horde and Alliance gaining powers, usually in the form of magical legendary items. He is, however, ruthless in his goals and pursues what he perceives as the greater good for Azeroth with almost fanatical devotion. As the self-proclaimed last black dragon, Wrathion believes that the titans\\' mandate to protect Azeroth now falls to him, and he will do whatever it takes to fulfill this charge once entrusted to Deathwing,War Crimes that he personally identifies as his father. Most dragons do regard their aspect as their progenitor since they were the genesis of their kind out of the proto-drake stage of evolution, albeit through the direct hand of the titan watchers, but with Deathwing\\'s infamous history it carries a bit more significance. \\n\\nAfter being purified and hatched during the war against Deathwing, Wrathion saw to the death of every other black dragon he knew of, including his father. He decided to take on the appearance of a dark-skinned human for his mortal disguise, and provided an adventurer rogue with the Fangs of the Father to hunt down the last dragons of the black dragonflight in Azeroth. After he nearly survived an assassination attempt of the red dragonflight, he claimed to take his destiny into his own hands and disappeared.\\n\\nAs the Alliance-Horde war intensified on Pandaria, Wrathion traveled to the once hidden continent and created his own organization, he then sought to use an adventurer gifted with a powerful cloak of his own creation in a plot to have one side wipe out the other,Judgment of the Black Prince making the world more secure against greater threats.Celestial Blessings While his plan ultimately failed when King Varian Wrynn decided to make peace with Warchief Vol\\'jin instead of dismantling the Horde, Wrathion\\'s ambition to safeguard the world remained unchanged. After he helped Kairozdormu release Garrosh Hellscream during his trial, Wrathion stayed in the shadows, observing the conflict between the forces of Azeroth and the Iron Horde, and which side would win the war in Draenor.\\n\\nFor years he traveled across Azeroth, seeking a way to fight the madness that once corrupted his flight. Near the end of the Fourth War, as N\\'Zoth was the one primarily responsible for his father\\'s corruption, Wrathion once again offered his assistance.Return of the Black Prince This time, he created :Ashjra\\'kamas, Shroud of Resolve to help Azeroth\\'s champions resist the Old God\\'s corruptive influence. Following the end of the Old God, Wrathion vowed that the black dragonflight would forevermore stand in defense of Azeroth, alongside its champions.\\n\\nWith the Dragon Isles rediscovered, Wrathion now contends with Sabellian for the right to become the new Aspect of the black dragonflight.\\n\\nBiography\\nCataclysm\\n\\nthumb|The Purified Black Dragon Egg, which contains the unborn black whelp Wrathion.\\nThe ambitious red dragon Rheastrasza, also known by her goblin guise Rhea, traveled to the Badlands to research the black dragonflight and to find a way to purify them. She hired a group of mercenaries,The Bad Dogs and has captured the black dragon, Nyxondra, to force her to lay eggs for the experiments, in hopes of laying a uncorrupted black dragon egg.Third Sample: Implanted Eggs It was later revealed that Nyxondra was in fact a sister of Onyxia,Dave Kosak on Twitter and thus a daughter of Deathwing himself, the grandfather of Wrathion. \\n\\nUnhatched\\nEventually, Rheastrasza and Dr. Hieronymus Blam succeeded in creating a purified black dragon egg with an ancient titan device, a black whelp corpse, a wild black dragon egg and one of Nyxondra\\'s eggs.Return to Blam She constantly moved around to avoid being found by agents of the black dragonflight, who wanted to destroy the egg. She was however killed by Deathwing in the end, who was after the egg.Rheastrasza\\'s Gift The egg he destroyed, however, was not the purified one, but Rheastrasza\\'s own egg. Hieronymus Blam had already moved the real purified egg to a safer location, away from the Badlands, so it could continue to grow, out of Deathwing\\'s sight.The Egg Lives On The egg was hidden under the care of Corastrasza in Vermillion Redoubt, a Red dragonflight outpost in the Twilight Highlands.A Hidden Message\\n\\nHowever, six months later, shortly before he was born, the egg was stolen by the assassins of Ravenholdt. Consequently, the red dragonflight sent the red drake Mostrasz and a rogue adventurer to find it. The trail led them to Ravenholdt Manor,To Ravenholdt in the northeast of Hillsbrad Foothills, where it was revealed that Wrathion has hatched and was now in charge of the whole operation.To Catch a ThiefCataclysm Recap Video: Legendary Rogue (Part I of IV)\\n\\nThe Black Prince\\n\\nthumb|left|Wrathion, the Black Prince.\\nThough a whelping, Wrathion was wise and powerful beyond his years. Free of Deathwing\\'s control, he saw with clear eyes what had become of the black dragons, and recognized the threat they posed to Azeroth. He knew of only one way to purify the flight: death. Thus, he launched a brutal campaign to assassinate the world\\'s remaining black dragons.\\n\\nOn his first encounter with the rogue adventurer, he revealed that like all dragons he was conscious in his egg, listening to the plots and intrigues about him, and understood that he was born to be a prisoner. Therefore, he announced that he intended to stay free, and that the rogue adventurer were valuable to him, as they managed to reach him by eluding all his guards in the manor. At the same time, the right hand of the Black Prince, Fahrad, brought Mostrasz into the cellar after he captured him. Wrathion introduced himself to the latter as his former prisoner, and ordered him to serve as a messenger to his dragonflight, announcing that he was free from his father\\'s corruption, that he intended to remain free, that Deathwing\\'s minions should be afraid of him, and that this warning was the first and the last. He then ordered Fahrad to throw him out and to break his legs, before resuming his conversation with the rogue adventurer, explaining that dark dragons frequently disguise themselves as mortals to create chaos around them, and that the last survivors of the black dragonflight must be found and eliminated, as they are threats to Wrathion and Azeroth itself. In exchange for rewards, they agreed to help the Black Prince, and their first mission was located in the Ruins of Gilneas.Our Man in GilneasCataclysm Recap Video: Legendary Rogue (Part II of IV)\\n\\nAs the only pure member of his dragonflight, Wrathion decided that it was his misson to make sure that all his corrupted brothers and sisters must be destroyed. The first of them was Lord Hiram Creed, a black dragon disguised as an affluent Gilnean noble who manipulated a group of Gilnean humans and worgen named the Blackhowl in Gilneas City, secretly infecting them with his own draconic blood. As none of Ravenholdt\\'s assassins were able to infiltrate the city, the rogue adventurer was sent to assassinate the Drakonid, and managed to kill him, to the surprise of the Black Prince who was greatly impressed.Assassinate Creed He rewarded them with the daggers named Vengeance and Fear, and promised them more powers if they returned with some spell reagents acquired from Deathwing\\'s minions.The Deed is Done\\n\\nTo Wrathion\\'s surprise, his rogue champion returned some weeks later with what he asked, and eager for another assignment.Cluster Clutch In order to improve the daggers he offered them, he ordered the elimination of Nalice,Blood of the Betrayer a black dragon who served as the Ambassador of the Black Dragonflight in the Wyrmrest Accord, but who mysteriously disappeared from Wyrmrest Temple in the wake of Deathwing\\'s reemergence and his shattering of Azeroth. She was found by the Black Prince and his agents, hiding with her Blackwyrm Cult in the Master\\'s Cellar beneath Karazhan, researching arcane secrets buried beneath the foundation to perform some sort of arcane experiments.Our Man in Karazhan Pleasantly surprised by their victory, Wrathion used Nalice\\'s blood to upgrade the vicious twin daggers of his favorite assassin,Victory in the Depths before dispatching them again into the fray to collect more resources.Sharpening Your Fangs\\n\\nthumb|Wrathion confronts Fahrad, a black dragon, about the Old Gods\\' voices in his head.\\nthumb|Wrathion uses his powers to immobilize Fahrad.\\nAfter some weeks, Wrathion greeted his rogue champion fresh and ready for his hardest assignment, ignoring Fahrad\\'s warnings, he ordered the adventurer to kill his father. He warned them not to underestimate Deathwing, and that it would be necessary to annihilate him completely, otherwise the heart of his madness in his broken body would try to destroy them. He confessed that he wanted to help them, but couldn\\'t bring himself to do so, as the Black Aspect was the only dragon he feared. In secret, he told himself that it was the last time he saw his champion, not imagining for even a moment that they could accomplish their mission.Sharpening Your FangsCataclysm Recap Video: Legendary Rogue (Part III of IV) But once again, he underestimated them, and ultimately, his favorite assassin returned triumphant to collect their final reward after they destroyed the Worldbreaker with the heroes of Azeroth.\\n\\nHowever, prior to their arrival, the red dragonflight attacked Ravenholdt Manor to kill Wrathion, the latter managed to survive and killed Mostrasz himself, although many of its agents were killed in the battle. After rewarding his rogue champion one last time with :Golad, Twilight of Aspects and :Tiriosh, Nightmare of Ages, the legendary , he announced his final mission, to kill the last black dragon, Fahrad himself. The Black Prince revealed that he already knew the truth since the beginning, thanking the latter for saving him while he was still in his egg, but announced that as a black dragon he was also a victim of the corruption of the Old Gods and must be eliminated. Despite Fahrad insisting that he was in control, the Old Gods\\' voices in his head were angered by Wrathion\\'s actions and forced Fahrad to try to kill the Black Prince, as he was too difficult to control. As Fahrad revealed his true nature, Wrathion announced that he would never be controlled, that the red dragonflight had no idea what they unleashed when they had experimented on his egg, before he immobilized his former ally and ordered the rogue adventurer to deal the killing blow with his new powers.Cataclysm Recap Video: Legendary Rogue (Part IV of IV)\\n\\nFollowing their victory, Wrathion announced that to his knowledge he was the last black dragon in Azeroth, and that it was time for him to disappear, expecting to meet his rogue champion once again in the future. With his destiny in his own hands, he left the assassins of Ravenholdt behind to seek his destiny elsewhere, as he heard rumors of a new land \"beyond the mists of the sea\".Cataclysm Recap Video: Legendary Rogue (Part IV of IV)\\n\\nWith his bloody work done, Wrathion stood as one of the last living black dragons.\\n\\nMists of Pandaria\\n\\nthumb|upright|Wrathion at the Tavern in the Mists.\\nIn Pandaria, Wrathion made his base in the Tavern in the Mists, which is found in the Veiled Stair, after experiencing a vision of Azeroth\\'s destruction.Annual 2015 To prevent his vision from becoming a reality, Wrathion sent invitations to adventurers from all walks of life to aid him in shaping the course of the coming conflict.Stranger in a Strange Land (quest)\\n\\nWrathion foreshadowed a terrible threat to Azeroth coming, a threat that a divided Azeroth couldn\\'t hope to stand against; the Burning Legion. Thus he believed the only way to prepare Azeroth for the coming threat was to have one faction win and dominate the other. He advised adventurers to bring a swift end to the Alliance-Horde war and gave his unwavering support to whichever faction the adventurer belonged to.A Legend in the Making\\n\\nWrathion challenged the adventurers he recruited to prove their strength to him by vanquishing the mogu minions who inhabit Shan\\'ze Dao, and the sha-corrupted mantid swarming the Dread Wastes. He also tasked adventurers to acquire sigils of power and wisdom from fallen heroes in the Mogu\\'shan Vaults, the Heart of Fear, or the Terrace of Endless Spring.The Strength of One\\'s Foes After slaying enough of these enemies to earn an honored reputation with him,Trial of the Black Prince Wrathion challenged the adventurer to hunt down the Sha of Fear and despoil it of its :Chimera of Fear. After taking down the sha at the Terrace of Endless Spring,Fear Itself and accomplishing all of his undertakings, Wrathion took the adventurers to Mason\\'s Folly where he used the combined powers of the sigils of power and wisdom; as well as the chimera of fear to create a sha-touched gem. After Wrathion gifted the gem to his champion,Breath of the Black Prince (quest) he asked them to let him know when their faction\\'s naval fleet arrived; and also proclaimed that no matter how unsavory his methods become, he would remain resolute in his protection of Azeroth.Incoming...\\n\\nLandfall\\nAfter the faction\\'s fleet arrived in Pandaria, Wrathion wanted to test the adventurer\\'s commitment to the Alliance-Horde war and thus tasked them to kill enemy faction soldiers at the shores in order to prove that their faction deserves to win the war.The Prince\\'s Pursuit Then, in the Tavern in the Mists, Wrathion summoned images of King Varian Wrynn and Warchief Garrosh Hellscream to talk about their pasts and how they fared as leaders.The Measure of a Leader Wrathion also wanted to test the adventurer\\'s valor by having them gather 3,000 Valor Points. He used his blood to see through their eyes, thus monitoring their progress.A Test of Valor (quest) Afterwards, Wrathion requested that they kill their opposing faction\\'s commander in Krasarang Wilds.A Change of Command In addition to slaughtering the enemy commander, Wrathion required that they achieve a victory in both Silvershard Mines and Temple of Kotmogu.The Lion RoarsGlory to the Horde After all these tasks, he brought up the faction leaders again and discussed their merits as leaders and what he\\'s learned about each respective faction. He asked the adventurers to continue to hone their skills in Pandaria and then armed them with the :Eye of the Black Prince to increase their prowess. At last, he brought up about a new threat: Emperor Lei Shen, the Thunder King.Call of the PackmasterThe Soul of the Horde\\n\\nRise of the Thunder King\\nthumb|left|Wrathion seen as a whelp at the Thunder Forges.\\nthumb|Wrathion and Anduin chatting.\\nthumb|Wrathion and Deathwing in Lorewalker Cho\\'s story. \\nIn the Tavern in the Mists, while Anduin Wrynn was recovering from his wounds, he played the pandaren board game jihui with Wrathion. Both of them have been discussing current events and as they played, they discussed Lei Shen the Thunder King, and his leadership style; to which they disagreed with each other if whether his tyrannical and brutal reign should be applauded or not. Anduin disapproved of Wrathion\\'s hard cutthroat outlook and Wrathion likewise thought Anduin too soft. At this point, Wrathion recruited the adventurer to act as his champion and to show his might by terrorizing any mogu, Zandalari, or saurok they could find.\\n\\nAs Wrathion desired to know the origin and source of mogu power, Azeroth\\'s adventurers aided the Black Prince in finding out what it was. The search for information took them into the depths of the Thunder King\\'s Palace, the Throne of Thunder, where they collected for him 20 :Secrets of the Empire and 40 Trillium Bars.Secrets of the First Empire Wrathion and the adventurer then progressed to the Thunder Forges where he planed to use all the trillium they gathered to forge an instrument of power that he claimed he would used for the purpose of \"world peace\". Once they got the Thunder Forge up and running, Wrathion tasked the adventurer to defend the Celestial Blacksmith from the sha until it finished forging the :Lightning Lance. Once completed, Wrathion\\'s champion used the Lightning Lance to vanquish the Sha Amalgamation. Although the Lightning Lance proved itself a useful weapon, it needed to be charged by the power of the Thunder King in order to wake it from its dormancy.The Thunder Forge (quest) Wrathion then asked his champion to assault the Foot of Lei Shen and to use the Lightning Lance on Storm Lord Nalak before slaying the beast.Spirit of the Storm Lord From the mogu artifacts the adventurer collected, Wrathion learned how to create the legendary metagem, Crown of the Heavens. After imbuing the Lightning Lance with Nalak\\'s power, the adventurer and Wrathion returned to Mason\\'s Folly where they created the Sha-Touched gem. There, Wrathion used the Lightning Lance to create the :Crown of Heaven, which he gifted to his champion.The Crown of Heaven\\n\\nAnduin distrusted Wrathion and warned the adventurer to think twice before putting that thing on their head. As Wrathion needed more information to piece together how the mogu related to the titans, he sent the adventurer back to the Throne of Thunder to collect 12 Titan Runestones, which an image of Wrathion used to uncover mogu history as he translated the stones.Echoes of the Titans\\n\\nOnce all of them have been translated, Wrathion wanted the adventurer to kill Lei Shen himself, to bring him the :Heart of the Thunder King, and end the Thunder King\\'s reign once and for all. Once the heart was given to Wrathion, he ate it and absorbed its titan magic. A glowing light appeared, showing Wrathion cosmic visions and spoke through Wrathion of a fallen titan that some mysterious power sought to rebuild. As the light faded away, Wrathion seemed to have forgotten all the information and thought the predecessors of the titans\\' power have forgotten as well. Not even Anduin could comprehend the message. To that regard, it was the message that the mogu didn\\'t remember all this time, and Wrathion laughed at the irony of it. Anduin still didn\\'t trust Wrathion, and the latter told him that it was wise that he didn\\'t. He then asked the adventurer to give him time to \"digest\" what he has learned.Heart of the Thunder King (quest)\\n\\nEscalation\\nthumb|Wrathion empowering the Timeless Essence of the Black Dragonflight.\\nAfter Lei Shen was dead, and his artifacts were in the hands of the Horde and Alliance, Wrathion wanted to empower his champion with the full array of his draconic power, but their mortal body wasn\\'t capable of holding such power. Instead, Wrathion planed to create a cloak of virtue that they could imbue with the power of the August Celestials and some of his own as well. To create such a vessel, Wrathion required the blessings of all the August Celestials, which was only granted to those who completed their challenges. Thus Wrathion and his champion set off for the celestials\\' temples to fulfill their quest.\\n\\nAt Niuzao Temple, Niuzao tested the adventurer\\'s fortitude; at the Temple of the Red Crane, Chi-Ji tested their hope; at the Temple of the White Tiger, Xuen tested their strength; and at the Temple of the Jade Serpent, Yu\\'lon tested their wisdom.Celestial Blessings With the blessing of each of the celestials, Wrathion was able to create the :Cloak of Virtue at Mason\\'s Folly, which he gifted to his champion. Although the cloak of virtue granted the champion the power of the celestials, Wrathion was still searching for a way to imbue his own draconic power onto the cloak.Preparing to Strike\\n\\nSiege of Orgrimmar\\nthumb|Wrathion breathes fire in a fit of anger.\\nWrathion was eager to explore the secrets of the Timeless Isle, and with good reason: the island held the secret of imbuing celestial cloaks with his own formidable draconic power.A Timeless Discovery Wrathion tasked his champion to collect 5,000 Timeless Coins so that he could deconstruct their mysterious power in order to enhance his champion\\'s cloak.Secrets of the Timeless Isle He also challenged his champion to showcase their capabilities to the public of the Celestial Court by defeating the August Celestials in combat.The Emperor\\'s Way Bearers of this new legendary-quality cloak were able to do battle with the deadly Ordos atop the Timeless Isle, but that wasn\\'t Wrathion\\'s ultimate goal. Instead, the black prince hoped to send his empowered cloak-bearers into the bowels of Orgrimmar to overthrow Warchief Garrosh Hellscream himself. Wrathion also participated in the Celestial Tournament with his companions - Alex, Dah\\'da, and Cindy. After the Celestials are defeated, Wrathion, Lorewalker Cho and the adventurer return to the Seat of Knowledge where they narrate the legend of the adventurer. Cho wished for the legend to portray the adventurer as a hero, liberator, and protector, while Wrathion wished to see them as a conqueror with none able to stand in their way.A Pandaren Legend After the legend was done, Wrathion sent the adventurer to the Siege of Orgrimmar to fulfill his hopes.\\n\\nWhen the adventurer arrived back in the Tavern in the Mists, Wrathion was pacing around the room; awaiting information about what happened during the Siege of Orgrimmar. The adventurer told him about what happened in Orgrimmar and he was not happy with the outcome: calling Varian Wrynn a fool for allowing the Horde to continue existing. Tong the Fixer was infuriated with his constant speaking and his lack of understanding of the lessons of Pandaria. Tong said that the Alliance and the Horde were not strong despite each other, they were strong because of one another. Wrathion thought he was just a fool waiter, and started walking out the Tavern and proclaimed for the battle to come, he would leave nothing to chance.Judgment of the Black Prince\\n\\nWar Crimes\\n\\nWrathion, alongside his bodyguards, Right and Left, attended the trial of Garrosh Hellscream, frequently corresponding with Anduin Wrynn during intermissions. He came to acknowledge the prince of Stormwind as a personal friend, though he told him that his kind heart and desire to see good in the world would be his undoing. He sat as far from Alexstrasza as he could.\\n\\nEventually, Wrathion revealed himself to be working with Kairozdormu and the Infinite dragonflight to free Garrosh and send him back in time to the  of thirty-five years ago. After incapacitating the Chu brothers so he could lock up Chromie for investigating Kairoz, Wrathion was confronted by Anduin, who attempted to deter his friend from freeing the captured warchief. Proclaiming that as the last of the black dragonflight, the protection of Azeroth now falls to him, Wrathion knocked Anduin out and took his leave. Despite his actions, Wrathion believed this would be best for Azeroth in the coming conflict with the Legion, and maintained hope that Anduin would eventually understand his motives and even stand with him as a brother when the time comes.\\n\\nWarlords of Draenor\\n\\nthumb|Wrathion outside Khadgar\\'s Tower in Talador.\\nWrathion, having traveled to the alternate Draenor after the Dark Portal became connected to it, traveled to Admiral Taylor\\'s Garrison in the Spires of Arak, brought there by Sir Edward. Wrathion sought asylum in the Garrison, claiming he had somehow angered the local ogres. As Wrathion was a wanted fugitive of the Alliance following the events of Garrosh\\'s trial, the troops led by Lady Claudia took aim. Admiral Taylor claimed that Wrathion would be a \"guest\" in the Garrison provided he stay under house arrest and full-time guard.\\n\\nWrathion provided Taylor\\'s Garrison the resources to build an inn, and when Taylor confronted him about it Wrathion told him not to trust Ephial. Taylor offered a group of guards money to keep a close eye on Wrathion, but Wrathion had already paid those very same guards to watch Taylor. When Taylor left to participate in the , Wrathion left the Garrison and took several of Taylor\\'s best followers with him.Admiral Taylor\\'s Garrison Log\\n\\nWrathion remained in hiding somewhere on Draenor until he made a minor cameo at Khadgar\\'s Tower once the adventurer had to return the Tomes of Chaos to Cordana Felsong. Wrathion was momentarily seen sitting on a Kirin Tor banner in whelp form until seeing his former ally, upon which he quickly flew off to parts unknown.Cooking the Books\\n\\nLegion\\n\\nDuring the third invasion of the Burning Legion, Wrathion wandered around Azeroth.BlizzCon 2016 Q&A\\n\\nDeaths of Chromie\\nWhen Chronormu and an adventurer discovered that the former was going to die in the near future, they began searching for clues to who could be behind her assassination across the future Dragonshrines in Dragonblight. At the pathway leading into the Obsidian Dragonshrine, they found Wrathion, who was bemused by skeletons occupying the shrine even though the dragons had abandoned it for some years, musing that his father would never have approved. Chromie and the adventurer confronted Wrathion, thinking he may have known something, and Wrathion was ashamed that Chromie suspected him simply for being a black dragon. As Wrathion explained, he knew nothing about the attack and was simply visiting Northrend for \"[his] own amusement\", but was surprised to see a demonic infestation at the Obsidian Dragonshrine. He reminded Chromie and the adventurer that if they were looking for someone who might take umbrage at a dragon, they should start with the undead and whoever was controlling them. Chromie agreed that Wrathion made a fair point and the two of them left him to search inside the dragonshrine.Preserve the True Future\\n\\nBattle for Azeroth\\n\\nAfter finding an :Unscarred Black Scale from a young black dragon while on an island expedition, the adventurer knew that Wrathion would want to hear about it and sought him out at Blackrock Mountain. Though Wrathion was not there himself, one of his Blacktalon Agents was. She revealed to the adventurer that Wrathion was searching for the Dragon Isles and that other dragons had not been forthcoming in information.Unscarred Black Scale (quest)\\n\\nOne of Wrathion\\'s Blacktalon Watchers was in the former lair of Deathwing, observing as another uncorrupted black dragon, Ebyssian, took an essence of the black dragonflight\\'s magic to help heal the world.A Friendly Face Later, more Blacktalon Watchers could be found in Nazjatar and in the Blackrock Mountain.\\n\\nWhen Wrathion was next seen, he had physically matured significantly, his humanoid form now resembling a young man with jet black hair, a short beard, and red, burning eyes. He sought out the Shen\\'dralar library in Dire Maul,Torn Journal Page #7 as well as the aid of the Lorewalkers and Shado-Pan,Torn Journal Page #16 in order to find a way to counter the Old Gods\\' corruption. He also traveled to the Vault of Archavon in Wintergrasp, hoping that it would contain information on the Forge of Origination which, he felt, would be the key to defeating the Old Gods for good. Unfortunately, the giants that watched over the Vault were not trusting of him.Torn Journal Page #25 Wrathion then journeyed to Karazhan, where he received information from the library that allowed him to craft a potion that could cleanse someone of Old God corruption. While within the tower, Wrathion also met with the shade of Medivh, who encouraged him that while Wrathion could not change the past, he could forge a new legacy to leave for the future.Torn Journal Page #58 As all this was going on, the Old Gods reached out to another uncorrupted black dragon, Ebyssian, and began to corrupt him. At the behest of Kalecgos, the adventurer sought out Wrathion for aid, and it turned out that the Old Gods\\' servants were also in pursuit of the Black Prince. While neither of them found Wrathion himself, the adventurer was able to find Wrathion\\'s potion in Karazhan and used it to save Ebyssian.Save Ebonhorn\\n\\nVisions of N\\'Zoth\\nthumb|left|upright|Wrathion entering Stormwind Keep.\\nthumb|Anduin Wrynn punching Wrathion.\\nthumb|Wrathion in his drake\\'s form.\\nAs the Alliance and the Horde defeated Azshara, and in the process let N\\'Zoth free from its prison, the Horde and the Alliance had to consider how to deal with the new threat looming. Wrathion, who had not been seen since Garrosh was freed, appeared in Stormwind City with Magni. He came to advise Anduin on how to deal with N\\'Zoth. Wrathion told Anduin that the armies of Stormwind would be useless. N\\'Zoth will strike in the mind.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB7DKeye3pE - Visions of N\\'Zoth - Intro Cinematic Later he joined Magni back at the Chamber of Heart and guided the adventurers in dealing with the visions of N\\'Zoth. Revealing that the best way to protect one\\'s mind against the Old Gods required an object pure corruption, Wrathion and adventurers ventured to Blackwing Descent atop the Blackrock Mountain in Burning Steppes. Upon arriving, the pair discovered that N\\'Zoth\\'s agents had seized control of Nefarian\\'s liar, and Dark Inquisitor Xanesh planned on making Nefarian\\'s legacy their own. Amidst the fighting, Wrathion was captured with the Dark Inquisitor revealing her intentions to use his essence to resurrect both Nefarian and Onyxia as tools of war for N\\'Zoth. However, Xanesh failed when adventurers freed Wrathion, who declared that the black dragonflight would purge N\\'Zoth from Azeroth. Following Xanesh\\'s retreat into Ny\\'alotha, Wrathion destroyed the remains of Nefarian and Onyxia and used the :Corrupt Black Dragonscales left behind to create Ashjra\\'kamas. Declaring that this cloak was all that remained of the once-proud black dragonflight, Wrathion revealed that it would defend them from sanity loss and the corruption of N\\'Zoth.Beginning the Descent\\n\\nSometime after Wrathion arrived to the Chamber of Heart, Ebyssian inquired as to how the Black Prince had known he had begun to hear N\\'Zoth\\'s whispers. In response, Wrathion admitted that he had one of his agents watching over him due to knowing that Ebyssian would become vulnerable upon leaving Highmountain. In a surprise, Ebyssian remarked that he was unaware that Wrathion had such a personal concern for his well-being, causing the younger dragon to remark that they were brothers and the only one that Wrathion had left.Ebyssian#Chamber of Heart\\n\\nthumb|Wrathion stabs the Carapace of N\\'Zoth with Xal\\'atath, helping the heroes to defeat the Old God.\\nAs adventurers entered Ny\\'alotha they had to face Wrathion, the Black Emperor, who was supposedly a Wrathion who had given in to the Old Gods\\' corruption, but after killing it they discovered that it was a faceless one in disguise rather than the Black Prince himself. Wrathion was present within the realm of N\\'Zoth, however. He was given the Blade of the Black Empire by Azshara who told him to stab N\\'Zoth in the heart with it.Dark Inquisitor Xanesh Wrathion instead stabbed the Carapace of N\\'Zoth which during the fight with the Fury of N\\'Zoth helped adventurers regain their sanity by teleporting back to him. Following the death of N\\'Zoth, when asked as to what lied next for him, Wrathion remarked that though the Old Gods had been vanquished, they were but one threat to Azeroth and that many more lurked on the horizon and in the shadows. He further declared that from this day forth the black dragonflight will honor its ancient charge and stand in defense of Azeroth, along with its champions.\\n\\nThe adventurers also brought forth young dragons of the twilight dragonflight, ones which had been raised inside N\\'Zoth\\'s carapace and so been exposed more directly to his corruption. Wrathion clears the dragons\\' minds of the whispers, with the promise that they, as well as he himself, will find themselves again one day despite their pasts.Lost Flight\\n\\nThe Vow Eternal\\n\\nWhile staying at the Summer\\'s Rest inn in Pandaria in his search for the Dragon Isles, Wrathion has a nightmare of transforming into Deathwing. In this nightmare he at first serves as the uncorrupted Earth-Warder and leader of the black dragonflight, only for a shadow to wash over him and turn him into his father. He is attacked by his allies, not only the Aspects and their flights but even his fellow black dragons.\\n\\nHe later attends the wedding of Thalyssra and Lor\\'themar Theron in Suramar. At the reception he encounters Kurog Grimtotem, who accuses all dragons of being unnatural but especially him because of the nature of his birth. Already stressed, Kurog\\'s egging on makes Wrathion snap and threaten him, but Kalecgos intervenes before Wrathion can go too far. With Thalyssra\\'s arrival to see what the commotion was, Kurog leaves while threatening that soon they would all know the true power of the tauren. Wrathion is rocked by what he had almost done, and remembers his nightmare where he turned into Deathwing with fear.\\n\\nWrathion leaves for the vineyard, and Kalecgos follows him with two glasses of arcwine. The two discuss the black dragonflight\\'s poor reputation and the falls of both Neltharion and Malygos. They muse on how both of their flights\\' former Aspects had been best friends, and Wrathion wonders if the two of them couldn\\'t spark a friendship as well. Kalec turns the conversation to the Dragon Isles, and Wrathion admits he has not learned anything new. Chromie had seemed confused when Wrathion had asked, Ysera is dead so can\\'t be asked, and Nozdormu wouldn\\'t even grant him an audience. Even Alexstrasza had only told him that the isles were lost.\\n\\nKalec and Wrathion both realize that they are experiencing a sensation of loneliness, or a weight on their chest, of feeling something they could not articulate that they wanted but could not have. The two of them doubt both experiencing this could be a coincidence, and wonder if other dragons are experiencing it as well. The two travel to Wyrmrest Temple to ask Alexstrasza further questions, where they discover that many other dragons have also assembled in a mass gathering at the temple\\'s base, all feeling the same sensation. Rather than wait, Wrathion flies to the top of the temple to speak to Alexstrasza personally.\\n\\nAtop the temple, he finds not only Alexstrasza but Nozdormu and Merithra as well. Alexstrasza tells him that they have heard the call of the reawakening Dragon Isles, a sensation reaching out to the hearts of all dragons. The feeling that Wrathion and all the others were feeling is homesickness, and Wrathion realizes he is finally being welcomed, and has a place to belong. The feeling of emptiness in his heart becomes one of joy, and he decides that his recurring nightmare is not a forecast of doom, but a challenge to be conquered. Now that he has a home, Wrathion vows that it will be him, not Deathwing, that will guide the black dragons into a new future.The Vow Eternal\\n\\nDragonflight\\n\\nWrathion struggled as to whether he truly desired to be the leader of the black dragonflight. Nevertheless, with the return of the Dragon Isles to Azeroth, he returned to his flight\\'s ancient homeland. Despite their past disagreements, Alexstrasza offered him guidance.2022-04-20, WORLD OF WARCRAFT: DRAGONFLIGHT INTERVIEW WITH JACKIE WILEY AND TINA WANG. Blizzplanet, retrieved on 2022-04-22\\n\\nWhen the Dragon Isles were uncovered, Ebyssian and Wrathion traveled to the Forbidden Reach and discovered the dracthyr, ancient creations of Neltharion that had been in stasis for 20,000 years. They helped the dracthyr battle the invading Primalists and the freed Primal Incarnate Raszageth. When the Primalists fled, Nozdormu told the dracthyr to warn the nations of the world of the oncoming threat, and Wrathion took the Obsidian Warders to Stormwind to introduce them to the Alliance. Afterward, Wrathion went to ask the Aspects who Raszageth was, and learned that she and the rest of the Incarnates were ancient enemies of the Aspects who sought to cleanse the world of the titans\\' \"stain\". The Aspects decided to reclaim the powers they had lost when they defeated Deathwing, for without that power they wouldn\\'t be able to defeat the Incarnates.\\n\\nWhen Wrathion brought Scalecommander Azurathel and the Obsidian Warders to Stormwind City, he mentioned that they would be well received through its connections with the leaders of the city. However, the opposite happened, and they were soon received by the Stormwind Army and the Spymaster Mathias Shaw who reminded the black dragon that he has been warned against making unannounced visits, especially when he brings company. In order to calm the situation, Wrathion apologized and announced his request to deliver a message from the Dragon Aspects to Lord Commander Turalyon. The Spymaster agreed to allow the dracthyr to visit the city but warned them that the SI:7 would be watching them closely and that the responsibility of their actions would fall on the Black Prince.Ground Leave (Alliance) In the Stormwind Keep, Wrathion briefed Turalyon on the recent events, and have extended the Aspects\\' invitation to the Dragon Isles. During a conversation between them and Scalecommander Azurathel, he thanked Turalyon for accepting the invitation and then mentioned that the Dragon Queen insisted that the Alliance should not bring any conflict to the islands with the Horde. After Turalyon claimed that the Alliance would honor its truce with the Horde, and that he instructed the Explorers\\' League to work in concert with the Reliquary, the Black Prince announced that he was delighted with the turn of events, and that it was time to prepare the expedition for departure to the Dragon Isles.Aspectral Invitation (Dracthyr, Alliance)\\n\\nIn the Waking Shores, Wrathion and his Blacktalon forces fought to free the black dragonflight\\'s ancient fortress the Obsidian Citadel from the djaradin. During the fighting, Deathwing\\'s long-lost son Sabellian returned from Outland where he had been for the last several decades, along with more surviving black dragons and a clutch of eggs that Wrathion had not been aware of. Wrathion restored the Obsidian Oathstone, only for Sabellian to declare his own intention of becoming the new Dragon Aspect of the black flight. The two began a competition for the throne. Sabellian and Wrathion also delivered the clutch of black eggs to the Ruby Lifeshrine for safekeeping.\\n\\nWorld of Warcraft Anniversary\\nthumb|Wrathion and Medivh in the Caverns of Time during the 15th Anniversary Event.\\n\\nMedivh and Wrathion were found partaking in the festivities of Warcraft\\'s Anniversary in the Caverns of Time.\\n\\nSells\\n\\nLocations\\n\\nQuests\\nRavenholdt Manor\\nTo Catch a Thief \\nOur Man in Gilneas \\nThe Deed is Done \\nCluster Clutch \\nOur Man in Karazhan \\nVictory in the Depths \\nSharpening Your Fangs \\nPatricide \\n\\nTavern in the Mists\\n\\n5.1.

Certainly he\\'s in Deathwing\\'s lineage. He considers DW to be his father, FWIW.\"Dave Kosak on Twitter (2013-04-30)\\n\"Wrathion likely took the \"Prince\" title himself, claiming to be the \"true\" heir of Deathwing.\"\\n\\nWhile Wrathion\\'s mother is clearly Nyxondra, the identity of his father is unclear. Neltharion/Deathwing is the leader of the black dragonflight and as such is likely seen as the father of the entire flight (which could be why he refers to Deathwing\\'s actions and why the legendary daggers are named Fangs of the Father). As there is no real shortage of other named (and unnamed) male black dragons, Wrathion\\'s actual father could have been any of them.\\n\\nThe Ultimate Visual Guide lists Wrathion as Deathwing\\'s son and as Onyxia\\'s and Nefarian\\'s half-sibling.\\n\\nKosak later stated that Nyxondra was Onyxia\\'s sister and tweeted out the following:\\n\"It\\'s kinda kooky, but Wrathion\\'s mother Nyxondra was Onyxia\\'s sister... so... Yeah black dragons are freaky.\"\\n\"You guys are right, Deathwing isn\\'t technically Wrathion\\'s direct biological father.\"Dave Kosak on Twitter\\n\\nThis would mean that Deathwing is Wrathion\\'s grandfather, not his father. This would also make Onyxia and Nefarian his aunt and uncle, respectively. This also corresponds with Wrathion\\'s own words when he called Onyxia his auntie.Judgment of the Black Prince\\n\\nOddly enough, an official page stated that Wrathion is a child of Deathwing,Archived page and War Crimes mentions Wrathion being sired by Deathwing.War Crimes, chapter 5 However, Wrathion was not technically sired by another black dragon, his egg was artificially created by the Eye of the Watchers which magically combined the purified matter of one of Nyxondra\\'s eggs with another wild black dragon egg of unknown parentage and a black whelp corpse.Return to Blam Annual 2015 also lists Deathwing as Wrathion\\'s father.\\n\\nIn Ultimate Visual Guide, Updated and Expanded, all mentions of Wrathion being related to Deathwing and his children are removed. In Wrathion\\'s entry, Nyxondra is listed as his only known relative.World of Warcraft: Ultimate Visual Guide, Updated and Expanded, pg. 197\\n\\nDue to these contradictions, Wrathion\\'s heritage was subject to much debate, with different sources giving different ideas as to how Wrathion fits into Deathwing\\'s family tree.\\n\\nIn Battle for Azeroth, there are still references of calling Deathwing his father. In Dragonflight Sabellian calls Wrathion his little brother, rather than his nephew, which he should be if Deathwing is his grandfather.\\n\\nDave Kosak on Wrathion\\nDuring an interview with WoW Insider in 2012 Lead Quest Designer Dave Kosak talked about Wrathion:\\nWhen we had written that questline in the Badlands there, we knew that this would be a cool story thread to pick up some day. But if you really think about how long it would take a dragon to mature and start developing his own thoughts, it\\'d be a long time. Like decades. And we didn\\'t really have time for that! So I said well, OK -- if we ask people to buy into this one thing, that because of these experiments he can have some self-awareness early on, wow - what an interesting character that is!\\n\\nAll of a sudden he\\'s so compelling. Because let\\'s see, his father was crazy and tried to destroy the world, his mother was basically raped by the red dragonflight, then his egg was experimented on to sever his ties with his own family - so how do you view the world at that point? Well, you don\\'t really view the world as a friendly place. You\\'re probably eager to take control of your own destiny, which he does, even before he hatches. And then you kind of have this thing to atone for - your father tried to destroy the world. Your father went crazy. Are you crazy? How do you not be crazy, how do you make up for what your father did. Suddenly he\\'s such a cool character! I really want to explore that character. We kind of went nuts with it. So we kind of asked people -- well if you can already buy in to the idea that he hatched from his egg and already started hatching schemes, then there\\'s a whole cool story that can come from that. And we really rolled with it.\\n\\nThat was kind of the genesis of that character. His value to the franchise is he really can kind of stand above Alliance and Horde, and really try and be a good guy, but without all the moral reservations that most good guys have. He really does have the best interests of Azeroth in mind, but his interests may not necessarily line up with our interests. His plan may not be the way that we would think of planning it. That kind of gray area between hero and villain is so cool for us, very cool to explore. And you\\'re never sure whether you should trust him or not. It helps that we got a wonderful voice actor who really gets that across. He gets that kind of, that air of arrogance and also a little bit of smarminess. You know, like you like him, but don\\'t trust him at the same time. Wonderful, wonderful characterization.WoW Insider interviews Lead Quest Designer Dave Kosak\\n\\nIn Hearthstone\\n\\nthumb|Wrathion in Hearthstone.\\nWrathion appears as  in the Mean Streets of Gadgetzan expansion for Hearthstone. Despite being a black dragon, his Hearthstone card lacks the Dragon minion type due to him using his human guise, a fact that is referenced by his flavor text:\"Wrathion, son of Deathwing, is a dragon. Why isn\\'t he tagged as a dragon, you ask? WHAT, ARE YOU TRYING TO BLOW HIS COVER??\"\\n\\nNotes and trivia\\nWrathion was two years old in Mists of Pandaria, in Year 30.Steve Danuser on the WoW forums This makes him five to six years old in Battle for Azeroth, in Years 33-34, and twelve years old in Dragonflight, in Year 40.\\nWrathion is one of the only dragons in the game the players have seen in all three forms of a dragon\\'s life. Having been introduced as a whelp, Wrathion was a drake by the time of Ny\\'alotha. And while a phantasm, Wrathion, the Black Emperor, shows a potential version of Wrathion as a dragon.\\nHe shares this distinction with Tarecgosa, though canonic depictions of her only appear through Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa\\'s Rest\\'s drake form, and her normal dragon form. Unlike Wrathion, where all three forms are encountered in a story perspective, Lil\\' Tarecgosa is only a pet.\\nWrathion has had several unique models. His original incarnation was as a young adult human male and featured dragonscale attire topped by a turban. His second appearance expanded upon this, abandoning the turban for long flowing hair. As a dragon, Wrathion was not given a unique model (his whelp model was the standard one) until he was given his drake form. A depiction of him as a corrupted dragon was also given for the Ny\\'alotha raid.\\nNotably, his second human form depiction uses the blood elf male animations instead of the human male ones as his previous incarnation did.\\nBy the time of the trial of Garrosh Hellscream, Wrathion was about the size of a large dog in his dragon form.War Crimes, chapter 27\\nWrathion and Deathwing briefly appear in Gods and Monsters (quest), a story told by Lorewalker Cho.\\nIn some ways, the Burning Legion\\'s massive third invasion was ultimately Wrathion\\'s fault. The invasion only occurred thanks to the alternate Gul\\'dan discovering and being sent to Azeroth, neither of which would have happened had Wrathion left Garrosh in prison. While the Legion would have returned regardless, Wrathion\\'s manipulations cost Azeroth numerous lives against the Iron Horde, Primals, Breakers, and other enemies; all lives who could\\'ve been better spent fighting the Legion. Anduin echoes this view in Battle for Azeroth.\\nWrathion is voiced by Aaron Phillips.Video Game: World of Warcraft\\nA number of fans pair him with Anduin Wrynn. In response, Christie Golden tweeted \"their relationship is only good friends.\"Christie Golden on TwitterChristie Golden on Twitter\\nIn the Legion alpha, Wrathion was in Highmountain disguised as Spiritwalker Ebonhorn, and at the end of his questline he gathered time-lost black dragon eggs to raise new, uncorrupted black dragons. In later builds he was replaced as Ebonhorn by Ebyssian and the questline was rewritten, mainly because it made little sense for Wrathion to have become a trusted sage of the Highmountain tauren in such a short amount of time.Gamescom Developer Interview Wrathion was based at the Obsidian Overlook, along with several characters from the Tavern in the Mists.\\nDuring the Battle for Azeroth demo at BlizzCon 2017, Wrathion could be found at the Stormwind Embassy.Blizzcon 2017: Battle for Azeroth Demo By the time the patch 7.3.5 PTR started, adding the embassy to the city, he had been removed.\\nHis bodyguards, Left and Right, might be inspired by the twin guardsmen of Olenna Tyrell from the  novels, who refers to her protectors as \"Left\" and \"Right\" since she cannot tell them apart. In the Witcher universe, the dragon Villentretenmerth also had the habit of being protected by two female human bodyguards that he referred to as \"his weapons\".\\nAccording to Associate Game Director Jeremy Feasel, Wrathion\\'s scimitar is named Succession.\\n\\nGallery\\n\\nFan art\\n\\nVideos\\n\\nPatch changes\\n\\nSee also\\nFangs of the Father\\nWrathion\\'s Recorded Journal\\nImage of Wrathion\\nImage of Wrathion (Throne of Thunder)\\nI am Legendary\\nWrathion (Battle of the Aspects Treasure), TCG card\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links\\n\\nCategory:Black whelps\\nCategory:Black drakes\\nCategory:Specialty vendors\\nCategory:Black Prince\\nCategory:Quest givers\\nCategory:Hillsbrad Foothills NPCs\\nCategory:Veiled Stair NPCs\\nCategory:Isle of Thunder NPCs\\nCategory:Jade Forest NPCs\\nCategory:Kun-Lai Summit NPCs\\nCategory:Townlong Steppes NPCs\\nCategory:Krasarang Wilds NPCs\\nCategory:Timeless Isle NPCs\\nCategory:Removed Talador NPCs\\nCategory:Chamber of Heart NPCs\\nCategory:War Crimes characters\\nCategory:Unique voices\\nCategory:Unique models\\nCategory:Hearthstone legendary cards\\nCategory:Deaths of Chromie NPCs\\nCategory:WoW\\'s Anniversary\\nCategory:Caverns of Time NPCs\\nCategory:Stormwind City NPCs\\nCategory:Ny\\'alotha, the Waking City NPCs\\nCategory:The Vow Eternal characters\\nCategory:Forbidden Reach NPCs\\n\\nes:Wrathion\\npl:Wrathion']"

       "'Deathwing the Destroyer,War of the Ancients Trilogy formerly known as Neltharion the Earth-Warder (pronounced \"nehl-THAIR-ree-uhn\"), was one of the five Dragon Aspects and leader of the black dragonflight. Ages ago, Neltharion was empowered by the Pantheon with dominion over the earth and the deep places of Azeroth. However, driven mad by the Old Gods, he turned against the other Aspects during the War of the Ancients,March Badness eventually abandoning his title of Aspect of Earth in favor of being the Aspect of Death.Battle of Life and DeathWoW TCG Card: Necrotic Boneplate Gauntlets Becoming one of the greatest terrors of the known world, his name too became one whispered with a feeling of fear and contempt among both mortals and dragons. He was perhaps the most powerful servant of the Old Gods.World of Warcraft: Chronicle Volume 2, pg. 127\\n\\nThe black Aspect involved himself in the Second War, adopting the form of the human Lord Daval Prestor in order to destroy the Alliance from within. As a human, Prestor was said to be tall, with a slim figure, black hair and clean-shaven hawklike features that were the subject of gossip among the ladies of King Terenas\\' court. He also had a quick mind and a friendly, engaging manner that endeared him to all involved in the Alterac crisis. It was said that he even got a smile out of Genn Greymane, the normally dour king of Gilneas.Day of the Dragon, pg. 227\\n\\nDeathwing also managed to turn his greatest enemy, Alexstrasza, into a slave of the Horde, with which he later allied himself. After a series of setbacks culminating in his defeat at the hands of the other Aspects, Deathwing retreated to Deepholm in the Elemental Plane to recuperate. From there, he observed his former mate Sintharia\\'s experiments with the twilight dragonflight in Grim Batol, and later continued his late consort\\'s work.\\n\\nThough believed dead by many, Deathwing returned in spectacular fashion after the fall of the Lich King. Entering Azeroth through Deepholm fractured the World Pillar, causing the Elemental Plane to start collapsing onto Azeroth. This Cataclysm reshaped the entire world of Azeroth and unleashed widespread destruction. As the world reeled, he appeared and brought flame to various regions of Azeroth.Stood in the Fire His ultimate goal was to bring about the Hour of Twilight - the liberation of the Old Gods and the end of all life on the planet. Deathwing was aided by powerful allies also minions of his masters, such as the warped ogre-mage Cho\\'gall and his Twilight\\'s Hammer cult, the powerful Elemental Lords Al\\'Akir and Ragnaros, and the Neferset tol\\'vir of Uldum.\\n\\nUniting their powers, the remaining Dragon Aspects sent adventurers to brave the unstable paths of the Caverns of Time to retrieve the Dragon Soul, an ancient artifact crafted by Deathwing himself 10,000 years earlier and destroyed shortly after the Second War, for it was believed to be the only means of defeating him. With the weapon secured, the Aspects took the battle to their corrupted brother, with the orc shaman Thrall as the wielder of the Dragon Soul, now imbued with Deathwing\\'s essence - the very essence of the earth itself. After the siege of Wyrmrest Temple and unleashing his most powerful minions, Deathwing took to the skies until he was blasted with the Dragon Soul into the Maelstrom. His body at last giving way to the corruption within, Deathwing made his final stand in the raging torrent of the Maelstrom, where he was at last destroyed by the combined powers of the Aspects and the Dragon Soul.\\n\\nDeathwing was the secondary antagonist in Beyond the Dark Portal, and the main antagonist of Cataclysm.\\n\\nBiography\\nDawn of the Aspects\\n\\nthumb|300px|The Dragon Aspects, before they were Aspects, facing Galakrond.\\nIn Azeroth\\'s ancient past, the Dragon Aspects were proto-dragons who stood united against a foe who threatened their entire species: the bloodthirsty Father of Dragons, Galakrond.Dawn of the Aspects description Neltharion was one of the more intelligent of proto-dragons, capable of broken speech unlike most of the other, more animal-like of his kind. During this time Neltharion did not seem to be the good-natured wyrm he would become as an Aspect, taunting the other proto-dragons for fearing Galakrond.\\n\\nWhen a blue-white proto-dragon named Malygos was attacked by Coros and two other proto-dragons, Neltharion helped to fight them off. He was impressed by Malygos\\'s power, declaring them brothers in blood. Malygos noticed something in the hills nearby, but Neltharion couldn\\'t see it. As he flew off, the land moved - a ripple no larger than a tall human.\\n\\nLike the other proto-dragons, Neltharion rallied under Talonixa by accepting her as alpha in order to deal with the threat of Galakrond and the not-living, though he did not trust her. During this time Neltharion and Malygos quickly became fast friends with Nozdormu, Alexstrasza, and Ysera. While not agreeing with all of Ysera\\'s beliefs Neltharion was rather stunned at Talonixa\\'s deception of herding the bitten into a cave and then collapsing it on them, which eventually killed all the bitten who had begun to act like Galakrond.\\n\\nNeltharion later found himself as part of Talonixa\\'s proto-dragon army that moved to combat Galakrond. Before the proto-dragon army engaged their enemy in battle Malygos devised a plan in which the army would fly higher in the air where Galakrond could not fly. Quickly informing Talonixa of his plan Malygos was relived that to note that she was considering it. However, hearing his sigh Talonixa took it as a sign of Malygos\\'s satisfaction of her bowing to his wisdom and engaged Malygos in battle. While Nozdormu and Neltharion were quick to help Malygos, Talonixa was helped by her two lieutenants. Despite Nozdormu encouraging a retreat, Neltharion openly called for Malygos to fight Talonixa and became the new alpha an action that enraged Talonixa and brought more of her followers to join her, which caused the trio to flee high into the air.\\n\\nUsing his not-living Galakrond was able to lure Talonixa\\'s army into a trap where he erupted from the ground when the army was in position and swiftly shattered it. After killing Talonixa, Galakrond was unable to devour the fast of the army due to the actions of Malygos, Nozdormu, and Neltharion. As Malygos broke off to find Ysera and Alexstrasza, Galakrond ended engaging in battle against the future aspects only to be driven off by Tyr after being stunned by his hammer.\\n\\nAn unknown time later, Tyr met with the five proto-dragons, informing them that Galakrond was sleeping in a mountain range to the north and that it was the perfect time to attack. He told them to eat before doing so, and just before they left Tyr held the octagonal artifact before Nozdormu and Neltharion as he had to the others before. After doing so, Tyr vanished in the blink of an eye.\\n\\nTyr and the proto-dragons met up near Galakrond\\'s slumbering place, which Kalecgos would later note in his visions was nowhere near Galakrond\\'s Rest. Save for Ysera, they all began the battle against Galakrond, who had grown larger and even more mutated than before. Throughout the battle, the octagonal object on Tyr\\'s belt glowed ever brighter. When Galakrond suddenly expanded in size without warning, Tyr\\'s hammer could no longer harm him. With a flap of wings, Galakrond called up a massive wind that scattered the fighters. Ysera suddenly appeared and Galakrond attempted to devour her, but Tyr silenced his laughter with a mighty blow from his hammer. Tyr pulled Galakrond to the ground and began to mercilessly beat him even as Galakrond began mutating further - as he began to resemble a true dragon.\\n\\nIn the battle, Tyr\\'s hammer and the strange artifact were knocked free from his person. Tyr reached to grab the artifact, just as Galakrond\\'s massive maw came within range and the monster clamped down on Tyr\\'s hand. Malygos moved to save Tyr, examining the bloody stump as Galakrond roared in triumph and grew ever larger. An unconscious Tyr was brought to a frozen lake by the proto-dragons, only to vanish from the shore. After being attacked by two not-living Ysera and the others found they could not find Tyr where they left him, concluding that some beast must have taken him for food.\\n\\nAfter recuperating Neltharion and the others decide to hunt down Galakrond in order to kill him once and for all or die trying. Nozdormu along with the others would be stunned to learn that Galakrond had begun to devour the not-living in order to feed his hunger and shortly after would engage in battle with the behemoth. During the battle, Neltharion would work closely with Malygos and the pair would ultimately kill Galakrond after they forced a boulder down his throat.\\n\\nAfter killing Galakrond Neltharion and the others were approached by two other watchers, who revealed that they had taken Tyr to help him. As the proto-dragons were acknowledging the offer, Nozdormu noticed Neltharion staring off toward the mountains, as if he were listening to something. Agreeing to protect Azeroth with his friends, the two watchers were joined by two others and the titans acted through the keepers to transform Neltharion and the others into the Dragon Aspects. One of their first acts was to encourage the rumor that titans created them from Galakrond, to prevent the truth about Galakrond from leaking to ensure no one would follow in the behemoth\\'s footsteps.Dawn of the Aspects\\n\\nAs a Dragon Aspect\\nthumb|Neltharion, the Earth-Warder.\\nNow the caretaker of the continents of Azeroth, with domain over the earth and the deep places of the world, Neltharion used his power with wisdom and benevolence, forging mountains and rivers for the benefit of mortal races.World of Warcraft: The Magazine Issue 1, pg. 11 His lair was located in a mountainous region near the night elf city of Suramar, where he stored one of the Pillars of Creation, the Hammer of Khaz\\'goroth. The shamanistic, cave-dwelling drogbar served him.Blizzcon 2015: World and Content Overview Panel In peaceful times, Neltharion was renowned for his wisdom and power and became known as Neltharion the Earth-Warder, a great protector of the land. Malygos, now the Spell-Weaver and the Aspect of magic, was his closest friend. They often had friendly banter.The Well of Eternity, pg. ??\\n\\nTwenty thousand years ago, Neltharion created the dracthyr.Lessons From Our Past Concerned at the rift between the Dragon Aspects and Primalists, he created these beings as \"ideal soldiers,\" combing the essence of dragons with the traits of mortal races.2022-04-20, World of Warcraft Expansion Reveal. YouTube, retrieved on 2022-04-20 Neltharion used a titan artifact, a gauntlet which he wore in his human form, to use order magic to keep the dracthyr under his control. Raszageth, one of the leaders of the Primalist rebellion known as the Primal Incarnates, attacked Neltharion and his dracthyr army at the Forbidden Reach and during the fighting destroyed the relic. Seeing no other way to stop the Primalists, this was the moment that Neltharion gave in to the whispers of the Old Gods that had long haunted him, and used their power to seal Raszageth away.Legacies Chapter Three\\n\\nWithout the titan relic which he used to control the dracthyr, Neltharion deemed them a risk. He ordered them into creches beneath the Forbidden Reach, and asked Malygos to put them into stasis with his magic. Malygos left behind a contingent of blue dragons to watch over them. They would slumber there, forgotten, for 20,000 years.Dragonflight Zone Preview: The Forbidden Reach Many years later, Nozdormu would come to believe that Neltharion still had a purpose for them, and put them into stasis so that one day they could choose their own destinies.\\n\\nThe Winterskorn War\\nWhen fallen Keeper Loken instigated the Winterskorn War, fought between the Winterskorn vrykul and the earthen, Tyr and his allies fought on the earthen\\'s side. However, when Tyr realized that they could not win against the Winterskorn clan alone, he called upon the Dragon Aspects for aid. The noble Aspects grew enraged upon seeing so many dead titan-forged. Their fury only deepened when they learned that proto-dragons had been enslaved. Without hesitation, the Aspects took wing and unleashed their powers on the Winterskorn\\'s iron ranks.\\n\\nMuch as they had done in the fight against Galakrond, the Aspects worked in unison to overwhelm and decimate the vrykul army. Alexstrasza held the Winterskorn at bay with towering walls of enchanted fire. Malygos drained the magical essence that fueled the constructs and golems, rendering them useless. He also shattered the enchanted snares that bound the proto-dragons and set the beasts free. Neltharion raised mountains from the earth to corral and contain the vrykul and their giant masters. Lastly, Ysera and Nozdormu combined their powers to create a spell that would bring a decisive end to the conflict.\\n\\nYsera and Nozdormu enveloped the Winterskorn in a cloying mist that caused the titan-forged to fall asleep. These incapacitated creatures were then locked away in entombed cities across northern Kalimdor. They would not know the peaceful slumber of the Emerald Dream. Rather, they would languish in a timeless, unconscious slumber for thousands upon thousands of years.\\n\\nCorruption\\nthumb|Neltharion in his human visage form.\\nAlthough he was revered as a Dragon Aspect, Neltharion silently chafed at what he felt was a burden that had been inflicted on him; though he could command the entire weight of Azeroth itself, that same weight constantly pressed on his body every waking moment, the load making him feel suffocated to the point that he felt his very spirit unraveling. Neltharion believed that he must bear this burden alone, but ultimately found it to be too much, and began to resent the charge placed upon him. The belief that the titans viewed Azeroth as an experiment only fueled his bitterness. During his conversation with Thrall millennia later, he admitted that he served the Old Gods largely because he believed that they would free him from this burden.Charge of the Aspects\\n\\nThen came the madness that destroyed Neltharion\\'s mind, changing him and his kind forever and leading to the creation of the powerful item known as the Dragon Soul, later the Demon Soul. The inner-voices of the Old Gods convinced him that he could have power beyond his imagination if he served them. The voices made him paranoid of even his own black dragonflight. Neltharion began to yearn for a world dominated by his black dragonflight — a world in which the other dragonflights ceased to exist and Ysera and Alexstrasza would be his petty slaves for mating. The Old Gods convinced Neltharion to create the Dragon Soul. With the help of goblin servants led by Meklo, Neltharion created a simple golden disc made of his blood and forged in the goblins\\' cauldrons and anvils deep beneath the earth. Empowered by Neltharion\\'s magic, the simple disc was magically shielded so that the other Dragon Aspects could not see within it. There was an evil within the disc, some taint of the Old Gods, though its exact nature is not known.\\n\\nNeltharion had the drogbar experiment with ways to merge the elements into a binding ore. He believed it would be the ultimate tool in his rise to power. There were at least fifty attempts.Ancient Neltharion Tablets\\n\\nWar of the Ancients\\n\\nthumb|Neltharion battles the Burning Legion.\\nWhen the Burning Legion entered Azeroth during the War of the Ancients, Neltharion saw the opportunity to complete his Dragon Soul. Guided by the voices of the Old Gods, he first captured demons of the Burning Legion and added their powers to the Dragon Soul. Neltharion then convinced Malygos to help him with the other Dragon Aspects. All of them agreed to give a portion of their powers to the Dragon Soul, including all dragons of their dragonflights. Neltharion proposed that the Dragon Soul disc could be a weapon of great power to destroy the demons of the Burning Legion. Unknown to the rest, Neltharion was the only one who did not give of his powers to the Dragon Soul. \\n\\nNeltharion, the Dragon Aspects and their dragonflights flew toward Zin-Azshari where the night elves held the demons at bay.  The dragons awaited Neltharion\\'s first attack. He grabbed the Dragon Soul and by channeling his destructive power through it destroyed thousands of demons with one swing of radiant magic. The Dragon Aspects watched in horror as Neltharion also killed hundreds of night elves and other allies along with the demons.\\n\\nNeltharion revealed the depths of his betrayal at last. Now with the disc at his command, he wanted all races and the demons to see his power and to bow to him. The Dragon Aspects attacked Neltharion in an attempt to take the Dragon Soul from him and to reason with him in hopes of determining the cause of his perfidy. Malygos\\' blue dragonflight surrounded Neltharion, but with a swing of the Dragon Soul, most of the blue dragons perished. The next swing of the Dragon Soul paralyzed all dragonflights and the Dragon Aspects in mid-air, rendering them unable to move or speak. Neltharion then struck out at the Dragon Aspects and their dragonflights, destroying many and scattering them far across the land.\\n\\nNeltharion\\'s betrayal struck a great blow to the Aspects, and their fear of being destroyed like the blue dragonflight kept them in seclusion. In desperation, the Aspects shielded themselves and hid to become undetected even by each other.\\n\\nRise of the Destroyer\\nThe growing corruption in Neltharion\\'s heart warped his body, as the angelic dragon began taking a more demonic appearance, similar to how Sargeras changed to a more demonic form after his corruption. Neltharion\\'s body cracked open, revealing his molten heart, and magma and fire flowed off his chest. His eyes became aflame in red, demonstrating the magnitude of his power and the depths of his evil. Thus was Deathwing the Destroyer born, and the Dragon Soul was renamed the Demon Soul.\\n\\nDeathwing returned to his lair in what would later be known as Highmountain. His proximity to the Demon Soul was ripping his body apart, so goblin smiths forged an armor of adamantium steel to serve as a vessel to contain Deathwing\\'s raging powers and keep them in check, which were then placed on his body by the drogbar, whom he had enslaved.In Defiance of Deathwing Only the adamantium plates bolted to his spine kept the power from destroying his body.\\n\\nThe Old Gods had manipulated Deathwing into creating the Demon Soul, but their true intention was that the demons would inform their lord Sargeras of the great power of the weapon used against them. Sargeras would no doubt want the Demon Soul to power the gateway that would let him enter Azeroth. By using the Demon Soul to amplify the gateway, the three Old Gods hoped to escape their prison beneath the planet. \\n\\nHowever, Malfurion Stormrage used the Emerald Dream to find Deathwing\\'s lair and stole the Demon Soul from the black dragon, who tried to pursue the thief in vain. Illidan and Varo\\'then captured Malfurion and took the Demon Soul back to Zin-Azshari, to Mannoroth the Destructor, the general of the Legion\\'s armies. It was used to power up the portal that would allow Sargeras to enter Azeroth.\\n\\nDeathwing tried one last time to recover the disk when it was being used by both Sargeras and the Old Gods, and actually succeeded in reaching it. Deathwing was almost destroyed in the attempt, but after he got the Demon Soul, an enormous surge of power made him lose his grip on the disk and sent him spiraling far away from the portal. Shortly afterward, an incarnation of Nozdormu from millennia later prevented the Soul from falling into the Well below and brought it with him back to the future.\\n\\nAfter the Burning Legion was defeated, and the Demon Soul returned from the future, the Dragon Aspects sealed the artifact with their energies, so that Deathwing should never be able to manipulate the Demon Soul. The artifact was hidden in an undisclosed location by Malfurion at the request of the Dragon Aspects. No longer in possession of the artifact and now unable to use it, Deathwing vowed to destroy most life and to wreak havoc on the planet. With his powers over earth, Neltharion caused volcanoes to rise along with the destruction already caused by the Well of Eternity\\'s implosion, sinking most of Kalimdor below the ocean. He himself chose Deathwing as his title, to better show his contempt and intentions for the lesser creatures around him.Day of the Dragon, pg. 135\\n\\nAfter the war, Deathwing retreated to Neltharion\\'s Vault near his lair in the mountainous region, which had recently been renamed Highmountain by the tauren living there in honor of the hero Huln Highmountain.Huln\\'s War - The Nathrezim Huln and an uprising of Deathwing\\'s drogbar slaves battled the Earth Warder, and with the Hammer of Khaz\\'goroth Huln banished Deathwing from the land, sending him to Deepholm.Titanic Showdown\\n\\nAfter Deathwing returned to Azeroth, he settled into a deep slumber. He needed time to recover from his wounds caused by the Demon Soul and to regain his strength. During his long slumber, the other dragonflights would hunt his corrupted black dragonflight to the brink of extinction.World of Warcraft: Chronicle Volume 2, pg. 139 - 141\\n\\nFirst War\\nTen thousand years later, the Dark Portal between Azeroth and Draenor was opened by Medivh and Gul\\'dan. The incredible amount of magic roused Deathwing from his slumber. He watched with fascination as Stormwind and the Horde fought, and he became convinced that the orcs would be the means to restore his flight to its full glory. However, he knew the other Dragon Aspects and the mortal races would oppose him if he came out of hiding. If the Horde could break Azeroth\\'s kingdoms, Deathwing could devote his full attention to fending off the Aspects. During the First War, Deathwing\\'s Old God masters urged him to take small steps to aid the orcs. He did nothing drastic, for fear of attracting the Aspects\\' attention, yet the Old Gods saw Deathwing\\'s intervention as a way to engulf the world in chaos.\\n\\nThe first thing Deathwing did was take the guise of a noble human from Stormwind and travel to Lordaeron. He charmed the aristocracy, and when stories of the Horde invasion finally reached Lordaeron, Deathwing openly scoffed at them. He told Lordaeron\\'s nobles that the tales were fabrications meant to hide growing problems with rebels in Stormwind, and his lies were much more convincing than Stormwind\\'s desperate pleas for help. To win over those who stubbornly believed the reports, Deathwing subtly influenced the minds of Lordaeron\\'s nobles with his magic, preventing them from taking any action against the Horde.\\n\\nDeathwing did not only involve himself with human affairs, either. Once he was certain Lordaeron would not send aid to Stormwind, Deathwing moved south. He took the form of a Blackrock orc and lived among the orcs for months, examining their society from the inside. He had easily sensed the hidden power driving the Horde\\'s actions, and before long Deathwing maneuvered himself into the good graces of several individuals. Gul\\'dan believed Deathwing\\'s orc disguise to be a loyal follower, Blackhand believed him a proud Blackrock orc, and Orgrim Doomhammer believed he was a stalwart ally. When Blackhand fell to Orgrim, Deathwing did not see it as an issue. As a servant of the Old Gods, he saw the shattering of the Burning Legion\\'s hold on the orcs as a good thing that only served to make them more vulnerable to his own masters.\\n\\nSecond War\\n\\nthumb|left|Deathwing in Warcraft II.\\nthumb|Deathwing as depicted in the Warcraft II manual.\\nthumb|Deathwing in a Warcraft II cinematic.\\nBut there was a problem with Deathwing\\'s plans. The Horde had been weakened by the First War, and if the rest of the human kingdoms were to unite, the orcs would not have the means to destroy them. Even if they could, they would awaken too many enemies in the meantime - if the Dragon Aspects learned about the Horde, the orcs would stand no chance. However, Deathwing\\'s Dragon Soul was still out there, having been hidden after the War of the Ancients. It contained the power of all the Aspects except Deathwing, and so could be used against them for destruction or control. And although the weapon had been enchanted after the war so that no dragon could wield it, orcs could.\\n\\nDeathwing granted visions to Zuluhed the Whacked, chieftain of the Dragonmaw clan. He was bombarded with vivid dreams of his clan taming and riding dragons. His clan had once ridden rylaks on Draenor, and to once again soar in the sky was an idea that could not be resisted. Once the hook had been set, Deathwing coaxed Zuluhed to the Redridge Mountains. The Dragon Soul was hidden deep beneath the mountains, protected by wards and the red dragon Orastrasz, untouched for ten thousand years. Dozens of Dragonmaw orcs died against Orastrasz, unfamiliar as they were with dragons, but they succeeded. Zuluhed ordered his clan\\'s greatest warlock, Nekros Skullcrusher, to retrieve the Dragon Soul. Sensing the dark power within, Nekros renamed it the Demon Soul. Far from the Redridge Mountains, Alexstrasza sensed the wards breaking and grew concerned when she heard no word from Orastrasz. She and several of her red dragons hurried south, though she believed that some mortal had found the disc and Orastrasz was currently hunting for it and that it would be easy to help him retrieve. In truth, they were heading right into Deathwing\\'s trap.\\n\\nDeathwing taught Nekros how to use the Demon Soul through dreams and visions. With it, the Dragonmaw clan was able to enslave Alexstrasza shortly after the Horde assaulted Khaz Modan. He could not use it on the other dragons as he had to focus on her, but by lashing out at Alexstrasza with the disc\\'s power whenever her dragons tried to intervene, Nekros was able to get them to do as he ordered. The Dragonmaw took control of the long-abandoned dwarf city Grim Batol in the Twilight Highlands and forced Alexstrasza\\'s dragons to accompany them by threatening their queen. While the Dragonmaw began to ride their captives as battle mounts, Alexstrasza was imprisoned within Grim Batol and forced to lay eggs so the Dragonmaw could raise loyal dragons from infancy. From afar, Deathwing rejoiced in Alexstrasza\\'s imprisonment. He continued to subtly advise Nekros on how best to use the Demon Soul to control the red dragons. Not only would making the Horde stronger help his plan to restore the black dragonflight, but he also knew that seeing her children be used as tools for war would make Alexstrasza\\'s heart suffer. And Deathwing would relish every moment of Alexstrasza\\'s torment.World of Warcraft: Chronicle Volume 2, pg. 155 - 156\\n\\nKryll, a goblin servant of Deathwing, was sent to infiltrate the Dragonmaw clan and to serve Nekros Skullcrusher. Nekros ended up being manipulated by Kryll into doing Deathwing\\'s bidding. The goblin served as an \"advisor\" to Nekros, whispering ideas to the orc in order to further Deathwing\\'s aims.\\n\\nBeyond the Dark Portal\\n\\nthumb|Deathwing and Gruul battling.\\n\\nEventually, the Horde lost their war and were forced to retreat to Draenor with the Dark Portal closed behind them. After Ner\\'zhul reopened the portal several years later, his forces were approached by Deathwing. He offered his own children for assistance in exchange for safe passage to Draenor. They agreed and Deathwing helped them prepare for several key battles to steal two artifacts from the Alliance in order for Ner\\'zhul\\'s newly reformed Horde to create new portals to other worlds. They then fled back to the Dark Portal to Draenor. Deathwing believed the world would be a relatively safe haven for his offspring and secreted away a cache of black dragon eggs there. However, the gronn did not take kindly to Deathwing and his black dragons trying to take over their territory and conflict arose between the two races.\\n\\nSome time after Deathwing invaded his territory, Gruul was met by the lost heroes of the Second War: Khadgar, Turalyon, and Alleria Windrunner. They were after the Skull of Gul\\'dan which Deathwing possessed (he demanded it as payment from Ner\\'zhul). After that, Gruul and his ogre minions, along with the heroes, challenged Deathwing from his perch in Gorgrond — killing his eggs and impaling his lesser black drakes on the mountain spikes. Infuriated by this act, Deathwing landed on top of them and attacked Gruul. Although clearly no match for the mad Aspect\\'s power, Gruul was saved by Khadgar\\'s miraculous spell when he disassembled some of the adamantium plates that were holding Deathwing\\'s unstable body together resulting in Deathwing\\'s retreat.\\n\\nHaving escaped back to Azeroth, Deathwing ended up in a fight with some of the archmagi of Dalaran and feigned defeat, falling into the sea, where most of the council assumed at the time that he died.Day of the Dragon, pg. 3 He was not dead, however, and he took a human guise, pretending to be a heroic noble named Lord Prestor in an effort to be declared king of Alterac, where he could manipulate the Alliance from within.Day of the Dragon\\n\\nSoon after Ner\\'zhul recklessly opened multiple portals on Draenor, the magical stress tore the planet apart. The energies released in this catastrophe altered Deathwing\\'s eggs, resulting in the nether drakes: partially corporeal and partially ethereal dragons who possess the ability to shift between the astral and physical planes. Without Deathwing\\'s guidance, these otherworldly nether drakes are just now finding their own way among the blasted ruins of Outland.\\n\\nLord Daval Prestor\\nDeathwing, posing as Lord Daval Prestor, managed to make himself popular with King Terenas and the kings of the Alliance nations, and for a while had a strong influence in the decisions of state.\\n\\nLord Prestor was a minor noble, dispossessed and without backing, who came from the north.Day of the Dragon, pg. 87 He came from one of the most mountainous and obscure regions of Lordaeron after his tiny domain had been destroyed during the Second War by a dragon attack. He and a handful of his close family traveled by foot — no mounts, not even any servants or guards — to the Capital City of Lordaeron, where he presented himself to King Terenas. Lord Prestor soon became an integral part of Terenas\\' inner circle. When debating on what to do with Lord Aiden Perenolde, the treacherous king of Alterac, right after the Second War ended, Prestor advised Terenas to depose Lord Perenolde and declare martial law in the Alterac region.Beyond the Dark Portal\\n\\nAlthough no one had heard of him prior to five years before the Battle of Grim Batol,Day of the Dragon, pg. 22 Prestor claimed bloodlines in the royal house of Alterac ensuring he was a distant cousin to Aliden Perenolde.\\n\\nGenn Greymane of Gilneas, Thoras Trollbane of Stromgarde, and Daelin Proudmoore of Kul Tiras debated what should be done with Alterac, protesting Lordaeron\\'s continued presence there. Greymane supported Perenolde\\'s nephew in his claim for the throne of Alterac. Trollbane advocated dividing it between Lordaeron and Stromgarde. Realizing that neither situation was acceptable and that Lordaeron could not simply annex it, Terenas — telepathically coerced by Prestor — believed that a strong leader trusted by the Alliance leadership should be put in place as King of Alterac, and he declared Lord Prestor as his choice to take that position. Terenas was even prepared to give Prestor the hand of his daughter, Princess Calia, in the coming years as part of a marriage alliance between the new king of Alterac and the king of Lordaeron.\\n\\nDeathwing\\'s ultimate goal was to obtain a high level of power and influence within the Alliance, so he could destroy it from within. He had begun his campaign against the Alliance by pitting the kingdoms of Lordaeron, Stromgarde, Gilneas, and Kul Tiras against the Kirin Tor of Dalaran - who Deathwing considered threats to his new identity. Because of that, the Kirin Tor of Dalaran had their misgivings. The red dragon Korialstrasz — in his guise as Krasus, a member of the Kirin Tor high council — attempted to penetrate the chateau of Lord Prestor, setting off a very powerful spell-trap known as the Endless Hunger. The powerful energies maimed him, but Krasus was able to discover who he truly was. Two other members of the high council, Drenden and Modera, saw that Prestor was a complete blank magically, implying that he possessed great power — \"possibly almost as powerful as Medivh\", as Modera put it. The fact that the Alliance leaders, including the normally stubborn Greymane, had given Prestor their support, and the fact that King Terenas appeared to be leaving Dalaran out of the loop entirely, increased the Kirin Tor\\'s suspicions about this unusual man.\\n\\nThe battle of Grim Batol\\nthumb|Deathwing fighting the Aspects while Alexstrasza manages to get free.\\nThe orcs of the Dragonmaw clan at Grim Batol kept their hold over Alexstrasza, even though the bulk of the Horde had already been defeated. Deathwing tried to frighten the Dragonmaw orcs into believing that the humans were attacking Grim Batol, so that they would move Alexstrasza and her eggs north to Dun Algaz; this left her eggs vulnerable. Deathwing hoped to steal Alexstrasza\\'s latest cache for himself to create a new dragonflight; though bearing the crimson scales of the Dragonqueen, they would be raised by Deathwing and carry his hatred for the mortal races.\\n\\nDeathwing used his pawns to manipulate the mage Rhonin, who had been sent to Grim Batol by Krasus, as part of a plan to free Alexstrasza. He saved the young mage several times and helped him reach Grim Batol, hoping that his appearance inside the mountain fortress would further convince Nekros to flee from it. Though the orcs were convinced and began leaving Grim Batol, Deathwing\\'s attack on the caravan, however, failed. Nekros tried to use the Demon Soul on Deathwing but was unsuccessful due to the disk having no power over the black dragon. He then sent Tyranastrasz, old and sick, to stop the Deathwing, but he failed and was killed.\\n\\nAt the behest of Krasus, the three remaining free aspects, Malygos, Ysera and Nozdormu, grudgingly decided to come out of their lairs and attack Deathwing. However, due to the power they had given to the Demon Soul, they were no match for the black leviathan. But Rhonin was able to steal the Demon Soul from Nekros, freeing Alexstrasza in the process. Furthermore, he discovered its weakness and destroyed it, releasing all the powers of the dragons who had given their power ten thousand years earlier. Deathwing was sent retreating with four very angry, fully-empowered Dragon Aspects on his heels, though he managed to elude them in the end.\\n\\nShortly after the battle of Grim Batol, Lord Daval Prestor vanished under unusual circumstances when Deathwing was forced to go into hiding, with his chateau abandoned and his servants gone. Deathwing\\'s influence over the nobles disappeared along with him.\\n\\nWorld of Warcraft\\n\\nOnyxia and Nefarian, offspring of Deathwing and masters of the black dragonflight in the absence of their father, have tried to control the world. Onyxia followed in her father\\'s footsteps by taking the Prestor name to attempt to manipulate the Alliance. She posed as a human counselor named Katrana Prestor for the new child King of Stormwind. Nefarian, meanwhile, posed as a human named Lord Victor Nefarius, Lord of the Blackrock Mountain in the Burning Steppes. He was able to enslave the Blackrock Clan orcs who served him on the top of the mountain, the Blackrock Spire.\\n\\nBurning Crusade\\n\\nIn a brief dialogue with Overlord Mor\\'ghor, Lady Sinestra (Sintharia) revealed that Deathwing survived the events of the Battle of Grim Batol, and seeks the Netherwing eggs to continue Nefarian\\'s experiments.\\n\\nNight of the Dragon\\n\\nDeathwing\\'s consort Sintharia serves as the primary antagonist of Night of the Dragon, carrying on Deathwing\\'s experiments of creating twilight dragons.

It was there that he encountered Deathwing, using the power of the Old Gods to imprison his spirit within. The corrupted Aspect mocked Thrall, believing that the Aspects sought to replace him as Earth-Warder with the mortal shaman, and claiming that the \"gift\" he had been granted by the Titans - his charge to defend Azeroth - was in fact a curse, imprisoning him to his duty. To demonstrate, he allowed Thrall to experience what it was like to have the weight of the earth on his shoulders, claiming that this was what the Aspects wanted - \"to damn you to a life of eternal torment\", as Deathwing stated it. He then unleashed a series of scathing attacks against Thrall\\'s earthen form; because the shaman had embraced Azeroth, and Azeroth embraced him, his \"wounds\" materialized in the physical world in the form of earthquakes. Finally, the Aspects called on the Earthen Ring and the Cenarion Circle to break Deathwing\\'s hold, bringing Thrall back to himself.\\n\\nThe Aspects decided that in order to defeat Deathwing, they would have to acquire the Dragon Soul in its \"purest form\" - a period not long after its creation, during the War of the Ancients ten millennia earlier. As the Soul was imbued with a powerful enchantment to prevent dragonkind from ever using it, the Aspects called on Thrall to be the wielder of the Dragon Soul in the battle against Deathwing.\\n\\nThe Hour of Twilight\\nDeathwing is the final boss of the Dragon Soul raid that opened with Patch 4.3.0. The final battle against Deathwing is actually two encounters within the same instance; one fought on his back as he flies toward the Maelstrom, and then the final battle at the Maelstrom itself.\\n\\nAccording to Alexstrasza, Deathwing had been so twisted by the Old Gods\\' power and would simply regenerate from any physical damage, no matter how immense. He could not be killed even if every living mortal in the world faced him at once. The only solution was to completely \"unmake\" Deathwing, to unravel his very essence, using the Dragon Soul.\\n\\nDeathwing also features heavily in the three five-man dungeons that lead up to the raid. In the first, End Time, the future is shown if Deathwing is not defeated and the Hour of Twilight at last falls - a charred Dragonblight in Northrend, with all life extinguished forever. Deathwing is shown as a burnt-out shell of his former self, his powers having, at last, destroyed him from within. His lifeless corpse is impaled at the top of Wyrmrest Temple, his lava-like blood seeping from his mouth. To prevent the Hour of Twilight, the bronze aspect Nozdormu sends adventurers to go ten thousand years into the past, to the War of the Ancients, and retrieve the Dragon Soul - having been completely obliterated by Rhonin and Krasus shortly before the Shattering - so that Thrall could invoke its power to defeat Deathwing, though his past self tried to jealously defend the talisman from the adventurers - but it doesn\\'t work. Once the artifact is retrieved, the adventurers must escort Thrall to Wyrmrest Temple and protect him from Deathwing\\'s minions, so that the weapon could be secured for the final battle.\\n\\nIn the Dragon Soul raid, adventurers work together to defeat Deathwing\\'s commanders in order to buy Thrall and the Aspects time to charge the Demon Soul. Deathwing\\'s forces were killed over several weeks.Cataclysm Recap Video: Legendary Rogue (Part III of IV) After the adventurers take a short trip to the Eye of Eternity to activate the Focusing Iris, Deathwing officially disowns Nefarian, Onyxia and Sinestra and then unleashes his ultimate creation, Ultraxion, upon the temple. When the twilight dragon falls, Thrall unleashes the Demon Soul upon its creator. Wounded, Deathwing flees, attempting to return to the relative safety of Deepholm, through the Maelstrom. Thrall, the Aspects, and the Adventurers give chase, riding the Alliance gunship The Skyfire after the Aspect of Death, battling his personal escort along the way. The battles against Deathwing lasted \"a few terrible hours\".Cataclysm Recap Video: Legendary Rogue (Part IV of IV)\\n\\nAfter catching up, the adventurers leap out of The Skyfire\\'s bomb bay to parachute onto Deathwing\\'s back and begin prying the elementium plates from his back, eventually making a big enough opening for Thrall to blast Deathwing with the Demon Soul.  Deathwing is blasted out of the sky, and crashes into the Maelstrom. The defenders of Azeroth briefly rejoice at having rid themselves of the Destroyer, but Deathwing rises from the Maelstrom. Without his armor, his molten form begins to mutate, granting him a form far more terrifying than before (somewhat resembling creatures like Iso\\'rath). The final battle for Azeroth began in earnest, as Deathwing continuously attempted to finish the job he started by bringing forth a second Cataclysm that would end the world. Each time, the Aspects step in and use their power to stop him until one final blow from the Demon Soul completely obliterates the corrupted Aspect, leaving only the remnants of his shattered armor. Portions of his metal jaw are brought to the Western Earthshrine in Orgrimmar and the Eastern Earthshrine in Stormwind to commemorate his defeat.\\n\\nMuch like the statue in Dalaran commemorating the fall of the Lich King, the monument also allows the ability to see the ending cinematic after Deathwing\\'s fall; speaking to Lord Itharius in Orgrimmar or Chromie in Stormwind will play the final cinematic.\\n\\nMists of Pandaria\\nthumb|Wrathion and Deathwing in Cho\\'s story.\\n\\nDeathwing makes two appearances during Lorewalker Cho\\'s history lessons. In The Zandalari Prophecy (quest), Zul had seen a vision a great armored dragon clenching the world with his ferocious jaws. King Rastakhan did nothing of the coming of this Cataclysm. Lorewalker Cho then established that his visions did come to past and Zuldazar was no more. In Gods and Monsters (quest), Deathwing can be seen alongside Wrathion.\\n\\nA council of the six greatest warlocks eventually sought the powers their defeated foes wielded, including Deathwing.Council of the Black Harvest\\n\\nDuring the Celestial Blessings, Niuzao and or Chi-Ji wanted to let Wrathion face his past and summoned a Vision of Deathwing in the process. The Adventurer and Wrathion defeated his father and Niuzao and or Chi-Ji told Wrathion that he is nothing like him.\\n\\nLegion\\n\\nDeathwing\\'s banishment from Highmountain at the hands of Huln Highmountain and the Hammer of Khaz\\'goroth is witnessed in visions during Mayla Highmountain\\'s trials to become high chieftain in The Path of Huln and Titanic Showdown.\\n\\nBattle for Azeroth\\n\\nAn illusion of Deathwing appears during the final battle with N\\'Zoth the Corruptor, raining fire down on the raid.\\n\\nWhen N\\'Zoth was freed from his prison, his vision for Wrathion was to corrupt him just as he had Neltharion, with Wrathion ruling the revived Black Empire under N\\'Zoth\\'s command. Ironically given Deathwing\\'s status as the Old Gods\\' most powerful servant, it would be his scion Wrathion who would play a key role in N\\'Zoth\\'s final defeat by coming up with the plan to use the Forge of Origination, as well as using Xal\\'atath to open a hole in N\\'Zoth\\'s carapace and allow heroes to begin the final battle.\\n\\nShadowlands\\n\\nA vision of Deathwing fighting the aspects appears within the nightmares of Ysera.Visions of the Dreamer: The Betrayal\\n\\nLocations\\n\\nPersonality\\nWhile Deathwing was once a benevolent entity, the whispers of the Old Gods have corrupted him into a being driven by hatred. He harbors a hatred for all mortal races and wishes to see them dead. He\\'s also been driven utterly insane by the whispers plaguing him, especially when in possession of the Demon Soul. Deathwing was so attached to it that, even when warned by the goblin alchemists who made his first armor that the Demon Soul\\'s energies would kill him if he kept it with him too long, he only agreed to part with it temporarily after being reminded that it would likely be stolen from him if he were to die.\\n\\nIn spite of this insanity, Deathwing does display a degree of cunning. Although he hates mortals, he is apparently willing to tolerate them if it can prove of any help in his plans, though inevitably he will do away with them when they have outlived their usefulness.\\n\\nDespite Deathwing\\'s overall loathing of mortals, he has a sense of respect for Medivh, and perhaps even a fear of, as he stated in Day of the Dragon that the Guardian was the only human he had ever respected and that he would have never willingly face him in combat,Day of the Dragon, chapter 13 though this might have technically been fear of the portion of Sargeras that was locked inside Medivh. He viewed Thrall in a similar way; when the Twilight Father expressed disbelief that Thrall could triumph, Deathwing made it clear that he planned to take no chances.\\n\\nHe also showed genuine loyalty to the Old Gods due to his belief that they could free him from his burden. He viewed the responsibility the titans gave him as a burden, a weight too heavy for him to bear, but also felt that he had to bear it alone instead of asking the other Aspects for aid. The weight of Azeroth that he had to bear pressed down on him, so much so that he felt as if he were suffocating and his spirit unraveling. He began to resent the titans for placing this charge on him, and the Old Gods promised to free him of his burden, which is why he agreed to join them.\\n\\nAs a young proto-dragon, Neltharion was a lover of combat. He taunted those afraid of Galakrond for being weak, and got himself involved in a fight between Malygos and Coros simply to show off his own strength. It was Malygos\\'s power which led to Neltharion sparking their friendship.Dawn of the Aspects, part 1\\n\\nNames and titles\\nHe is usually referred to as \"Deathwing\" by the majority of beings. Only a few mages, night elves and dragons still call him \"Neltharion\". However, over the years Deathwing has been given many names, including, but not limited to:\\n\\nAspect of Death \\nthe Betrayer\\nthe Black\\nBlack dragonlordThe Brood of Onyxia\\nthe Black Scourge (used by the other Dragon Aspects)\\nBlackwing Greatfather (used by the gronn)\\nBlood\\'s Shadow (used by the orcs)The Well of Eternity, pg. 101\\nthe Cataclysm \\nthe Dark One\\nLord Daval Prestor, claimant to the throne of Alterac (human disguise)Day of the Dragon, pg. 87Ultimate Visual Guide, index\\nDeath AspectLegacy of the Aspects\\nDeath Incarnate \\nthe Destroyer \\nthe Earth-Warder (granted by the Titans)\\nthe Great OneThrall: Twilight of the Aspects\\nShuul\\'wah (used by the faceless; assumed to mean \"Deathwing\" in Shath\\'Yar), and Phquathi, assumed to mean DestroyerWarlord Zon\\'ozzYor\\'sahj the Unsleeping\\nthe Unmaker of Worlds \\nthe Warder of the landThe Demon Soul\\nthe Worldbreaker \\nXaxas (used by the night elves; \"chaos\", \"fury\" or \"elemental fury\" in Darnassian)Day of the Dragon, pg. 136The Art of World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, pg. 6\\n\\nMemorable quotes\\nWar of Ancients Trilogy\\n\\n\"You will learn to show respect.

The Well of Eternity described him as a winged behemoth as black as night with a noble bearing. Narrow veins of actual silver and gold streaking from front to back accented his spine and sides, while gleaming flashes between the scales hinted at diamonds and other precious stones embedded naturally in his hide.The Well of Eternity, chapter 16\\n\\nOne of the big questions during the Cataclysm development was \"what does Deathwing look like?\". Deathwing had been established in lore for a long time, but he had never been depicted in that much detail other than some images from Chris Metzen and Warcraft II. But to have a really comprehensive design for Deathwing was an early top priority. The developers wanted Deathwing to have a unique, nasty, and aggressive look, but also wanted to have the preexisting World of Warcraft dragons look as if they were part of the same family. They headed into the idea that Deathwing\\'s rage manifests itself literally as the boiling lava inside him and he actually needs metal plates to contain them. In their search for a unique signature that would set Deathwing apart from the other dragons, the development team experimented with his jaw. So they replaced his jaw on an early sketch with a metallic one and made it bigger, giving him a very unique silhouette. When they showed it to the game team the immediate reaction was extremely positive.BlizzCon 2010 WoW: Cataclysm Cinematic Panel Part 2\\n\\nIn the RPG\\n\\nthumb|Deathwing in Shadows & Light.\\nDescriptionThe massive monstrosity before you rises up like a black, crag-covered mountain of scales and hide. The head is a spade-like terror spiked with cruel red eyes that shine with a frightening malevolence. Rivulets of lava and magma are visible beneath the great wyrm’s scorched scales.Shadows & Light, pg. 93\\n\\nWhen he succumbed, Neltharion ceased to exist, taking up a new name and a bitter purpose. He became Deathwing and his subjects were placed beneath the iron rule of a tyrant. Upon his irrevocable shift to evil, he turned against his destiny, and his mind unwound, causing suffering wherever he could.Manual of Monsters, pg. 29 Certain legends surrounding Deathwing claim that as the Earth-Warder, Deathwing shaped the land so the races would not go to war over land and resources. When he went mad, Deathwing lowered the mountains and allowed the races to intermingle. He ruined fertile land and destroyed other terrain so that the races would be forced to fight for food. Deathwing\\'s efforts gave birth to an occupation that has remained with all races since then: war.\\n\\nCombat\\nDeathwing is a terrifying opponent who is as cruel as he is vicious. He cares nothing for honor or nobility, striking with whatever weapons and cunning he has at his disposal, reveling in causing earthquakes and ripping open volcanic fissures. He often sends his minions into combat while he surveys the battlefield, striking at whatever weaknesses he discovers.\\n\\nDaval Prestor\\nHe was a young human diplomat and noble that joined the high council of the Alliance during the Second War.Lands of Conflict, pg. 34Shadows & Light, pg. 94\\n\\nDragonblight\\nThe ancient black dragon Deathwing returned to Northrend and landed in the Dragonblight, at the foot of Wyrmrest Temple. He announced that he is close to death and wishes to end his life there with the others already present. Many of the blue dragons were furious that their ancient enemy would claim such an honor there. Others admired his willingness to set aside the past. The non-dragons were simply excited at the idea that such a powerful dragon was there. The Lich King wants to corrupt him and make him undead while the nerubians want to enlist him in their cause and unleash him upon the Scourge before he dies. Scavengers want his bones and flesh and treasure-hunters want his skin and claws and any items he carries. The heroes will have to keep this situation from escalating into a multi-sided war.Lands of Mystery, pg. 101\\n\\nWarcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans\\nthumb|Thrall\\'s encounter with Deathwing.\\n\\nDuring the canceled Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans game, Thrall would have met with Deathwing in order to match wits. Deathwing had his lair in upper Blackrock Spire, and Thrall had to kill him in order to gain Alexstrasza\\'s trust. Thrall killed him by closing shut his fire-breathing organs from inside his very body with a metal trap, leading to the evil dragon exploding when trying to use his fire breath against the orc.\\n\\nThe fact that Deathwing was seen smoking a hookah was blamed on a \"miscommunication\",GameSpot: Warcraft Adventures but Blizzard chose to keep it anyway.\\n\\nDeathwing was said by Alexstrasza to be one of his sons. He was served by trolls which had mottled and grey skin, a fact that might have inspired the description of the trolls later said to have served him during the War of the Ancients,The Sundering, pg. 67 and maybe even the drogbar.\\n\\nIn Hearthstone\\n\\nDeathwing appears as  in Hearthstone. His flavor text reads: \"Once a noble dragon known as Neltharion, Deathwing lost his mind and shattered Azeroth before finally being defeated. Daddy issues?\"An alternate, non-canonical version of Deathwing, known as , appears as a legendary card in the Whispers of the Old Gods expansion. According to Ben Brode, this version of the character is a look at an alternate universe in which the Worldbreaker succeeded in bringing about the Hour of Twilight but has not yet impaled himself upon Wyrmrest Temple. However, Brode agreed that this fact was not made particularly clear to players, especially those not familiar with Warcraft lore.Ben Brode on TwitterBen Brode on Twitter The Dragonlord\\'s flavor text reads: \"To his credit, Deathwing really took to heart the feedback he was receiving that he needed to be \"more of a team player\".\"Deathwing reappears once more in the Descent of Dragons expansion as the legendary warrior card .

His flavor text reads: \"Deathwing, a.k.a.

In April of 2017, a short Twitter teaser for the upcoming Hanamura Showdown cinematic led a number of players to believe that Deathwing would be added as a hero in the near future. However, once the cinematic released, it was revealed that the new hero was actually the Overwatch character  and the teaser had merely been hinting at \\'s presence in the cinematic. This became the subject of various memes which were later referenced by Blizzard when they added the Deathwing-themed  skin, followed in 2018 by a \"\" spray referencing the original teaser. When Deathwing was eventually announced as a hero in October of 2019, Blizzard again paid homage to the meme by preceding the announcement with a teaser image mimicking the original Hanamura Showdown teaser.\\n\\nNotes and trivia\\nNeltharion collected many valuable relics. The Earthen Amulet was one of them.Neltharion\\'s Lair: The Earthen Amulet\\nAt BlizzCon 2009, it was said that Deathwing\\'s plate armor was made of iron, despite it being said to be adamantium in Day of the Dragon.Day of the Dragon, chapter 1 Years later, the adamantium was again said to be the metal used on his armor.Ultimate Visual Guide, pg. 57\\nRemnants of the adamantium plating were left behind in his former lair.Neltharion\\'s Lair: Presentation is Key\\nDeathwing is voiced by Michael McConnohie in World of Warcraft, and by Patrick Seitz in Hearthstone.\\nDeathwing\\'s original lore was that he was a unique black dragon (rather than part of a dragonflight) and that his plates of adamantine steel were crafted by goblin alchemists during the Second War.Warcraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal manual, Legends of the Land, Deathwing His lair was also originally situated on the isle of Ashran instead of in the Blade\\'s Edge Mountains.Deathwing (WC2 Human)\\nIn Stormrage, Deathwing appeared in Korialstrasz\\'s nightmare, in which the red dragon became the source of the new Demon Soul.Stormrage\\nDeathwing was featured on the Cataclysm login screen, with his claws grasping two Stormwind towers at the Valley of Heroes.\\nDeathwing was designed to have a wingspan of about 365 meters, or 1,200 feet.BlizzCon 2010 WoW: Cataclysm Cinematic Panel Part 3\\n From this measurement, YouTuber Aerawave estimated Deathwing\\'s length at around 600 feet long (about 183 meters) and his height at 183 feet tall (about 56 meters).Deathwing\\'s TRUE Size by Aerawave\\nElling Trias predicted Deathwing\\'s attack on Stormwind City.Look to an Old Friend\\nAccording to Matt Burns, in the future the Old Gods drove Deathwing insane and made him impale himself on Wrymrest Temple, as they deemed him useful no longer.Matt Burns on Twitter\\nTwo submarines buildable at the Lunarfall and Frostwall Shipyards are named \"Neltharion\\'s Madness\" after him.\\nDeathy from Smoldering Murloc Egg is a murloc companion that looks like Deathwing that was given out for BlizzCon 2010.\\nThe companion pet Lil\\' Deathwing is the special companion given to those that own World of Warcraft: Cataclysm Collector\\'s Edition.\\nThe Obsidian Worldbreaker is a Deathwing-themed mount rewarded from completing the Memories of Fel, Frost and Fire achievement during :WoW\\'s 15th Anniversary.\\nDeathwing is pictured on Darkmoon Card: Death.\\nPlayers can transform into Deathwing\\'s human form using Exquisite Costume Set: \"Deathwing\".\\nDespite featuring in promotional material, Deathwing never actually assumed his Cataclysm-era human form in-game. The model is used thrice in World of Warcraft: during one of the tall tales in the Badlands,The Day that Deathwing Came: What Really Happened during one of Lorewalker Cho\\'s tales,Gods and Monsters (quest) and during a trial of the Celestials.Celestial Blessings All of these constitute fiction within the game. However, he does assume his mortal guise in Charge of the Aspects.

Likewise, Bahamut as depicted in  is a massive dragon that, like Deathwing, completely changed the game upon his appearance.\\nOne of the lines spoken by Deathwing in Enter the Dragon Queen () bears some similarity to a line from the  famously quoted by , the \"father of the atomic bomb\": \"Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.\"At some point during the Cataclysm beta, there was a scene where Deathwing\\'s humanoid model grew a pair of tentacles.

No version of Katrana\\'s cover story has given exact details of how the persona is related to Daval Prestor, though it is speculated that she claimed to be Daval\\'s daughter since her true identity, Onyxia, is the daughter of Daval\\'s true identity Deathwing.\\nNeltharion may have been the Speaker of Azeroth before Magni Bronzebeard. The title does not seem to have been invented for Magni, as he gained the role as the result of an ancient earthen ritual and many titan-forged recognize the position even when it\\'s their first time meeting Magni. It would mesh with the Earth-Warder\\'s duty of safeguarding the earth, and Deathwing does state in Charge of the Aspects\\'\\' how the gift of the Earth-Warder was \"to feel the fiery heart of this world as your own\" and \"to feel the weight of this dying world on your shoulders\", which resembles Magni saying he can feel Azeroth\\'s pain.
